TWIN sisters Thabisa and Thabile Nqonjela were ready to write their English paper on Wednesday, along with thousands of other matriculants in Mzansi.Instead, the two pupils at a senior school in Kentane claimed their principal told them to leave.The 20-year-old twins said their relationship with the principal broke down towards the beginning of the trial exams in September.Thabisa claimed the principal told officials on Wednesday that the twins could not write exams because they did not write three trial papers. My mum explained to the officials why we were not at school on those days in September. This was because of a personal matter regarding our living arrangements we were renting a place in the village. The officials left without sorting anything out for us, and we did not write the English paper. The principal declined to comment over the phone saying she would rather talk face to face to back her decision. Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said there was no reason to prevent registered grade 12 pupils from writing their exams. The pupils need to rush to the district assessment and examinations directorate and submit affidavits stating why they did not attend school in September, he said.
