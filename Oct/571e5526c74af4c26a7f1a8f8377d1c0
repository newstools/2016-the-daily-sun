FOR too long, women have been misled and misinformed about their own genitals. It&rsquo;s time to stop the cycle. Far too many women know far too little about their own vaginas. Did you know the internal (and by far largest) part of the clitoris was only discovered in the 90s? According to The Museum of Sex, urologist Helen O&rsquo;Connell used MRI technology to study the female anatomy and made great discoveries. It&rsquo;s time to stop the cycle of shame, taboo and ignorance. Let&rsquo;s look at popular, pervading myths about our vaginas: Myth 1: The clitoris is the tiny nub at the top of your vulva&nbsp; Fact: The little external bud is merely the ears of the hippo sticking out above the water. The largest part of the clitoris is internal and surrounds the vaginal canal, like a hug. Myth 2: A dry vagina is a tight, chaste vagina&nbsp; Fact: A dry vagina is a vagina that shouldn&rsquo;t be participating in sexual intercourse. Dry sex increases friction during intercourse, but not in a good way. Since dry sex often leads to tears in the vaginal wall it increases the spreading of STDs such as HIV. It can also lead to pain, discomfort and infection for women. Healthy sex requires lubrication. Myth 3: You have to wash the inside of your vagina with soap and water&nbsp; Fact: Washing is not recommended. It can upset the delicate balance of organisms in the vagina and lead to thrush, itchiness and discomfort. The vagina cleans itself, so regular washing of the vulva (outside bits) with warm water is sufficient.&nbsp;
