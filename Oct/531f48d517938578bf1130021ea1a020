THE SIMONS family from Hospital Park in Harrismith, KZN Midlands are praying day and night. Their 16-year-old daughter has mysteriously disappeared. Luyanda Simons who has a slight mental disability, went missing last Wednesday after hanging out with two of her friends in the area.Her mum, Zodwa Luthuli (42) said she prays that her daughter is found. She said she fears that the worst might happen to her if she is not brought home soon.&ldquo;When I call her cellphone it sometimes rings. Someone answers it but they just keep quiet.&rdquo;&ldquo;I still believe that she is alive. I think she was kidnapped and her kidnappers are keeping her somewhere. I pray that they don&rsquo;t do anything evil thing to her.&rdquo;She said she heard that on the day she disappeared she was hanging out with her friends who she only sees during school holidays as she studies at a special school in Pietermaritzburg.&ldquo;What worries me is that she is a slow learner.&rdquo; She said what confuses her was that people tell her that the three were seen sitting next to a tavern.She was surprised because she has never encouraged her daughter to drink.&ldquo;Maybe they had a few drinks and she passed out. Someone might have taken advantage and abducted her. When I asked the friends who were with her if they knew where she was they said they had no idea.&rdquo; Captain Nqobile Gwala, KZN police spokeswoman, said Luyanda was last seen near the BP Garage on Harrismith road.&ldquo;She is light in complexion and has a slim body structure. She has an Afro hairstyle and black eyes. &ldquo;On the day she disappeared she was wearing blue jeans, a white T-shirt and white All-Star takkies.&rdquo;Gwala asked anyone who might have information about Luyanda to contact Ladysmith cop shop on 036 6383308/9 during office hours or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
