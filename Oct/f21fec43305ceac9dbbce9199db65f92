&ldquo;I WATCHED in horror as my mother&rsquo;s favourite tea set burnt.&rdquo; These were the sad words of Richard Leoto (51) of Sekampaneng, north of Tshwane. He said he lost all the memories of his late mum because of vutha that destroyed his home on Sunday evening. His mum Sebina Leoto died five years ago and left many beautiful things behind.Richard said he was watching TV when he heard people fighting outside.&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to intervene because I knew that they were drunkards fighting in the neighbour&rsquo;s tavern as they normally do on weekends. &ldquo;But an inner voice insisted that I go and check what was going on. Immediately after going out, my neighbour told me that there was a cloud of smoke coming out of my shack. &ldquo;When I went to investigate I saw that my shack was on fire. I tried to get inside to save my mother&rsquo;s favourite tea set but the flames were too strong for me. I could only watch as everything that my mum left for me burnt to ashes.&rdquo; He said that he didn&rsquo;t understand what caused the fire.&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t cook during the day, I had leftovers from the night before.&rdquo;He said he believed jealous people sent the fire which left him with only the clothes he was wearing&ldquo;I felt closer to my mum when I slept in some of her blankets and her bed.&rdquo;Richard&rsquo;s neighbours came together to help Richard rebuild the shack and to donated clothes for him. His neighbour Charles Matlwa said that they were sad about what happened.
