KWAITO star, Antony &ldquo;Tsekeleke&rdquo; Motaung, has suddenly found himself with an enormous problem on his hands.That&rsquo;s because the legend, who made a name for himself in mid-2000s, faces the prospect of either chopping his leg or losing his life.This decision Tsekeleke faces stems from his 10-year battle with sugar diabetes and high-blood pressure, resulting in a sore &ndash; that won&rsquo;t heal &ndash; on the side of his right foot.But the Tsekeleke hitmaker refused to go down without a fight, turning instead to divine intervention.&ldquo;In one of my recent dreams, I was shown an image of prophet Paseka &ldquo;Mboro&rdquo; Motsoeneng,&rdquo; Tsekeleke said.&ldquo;The voice in my dream told me he was the only person who could help me.&rdquo;Tsekeleke said his illness had become so severe that he had lost feeling in his leg.&ldquo;The sore not only looks bad, but it has made my whole foot to lose sensation,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t feel anything, and the pain I experience starts all the way from the upper part of my leg.&rdquo;He said he had yet to find a doctor who could remedy the situation.&ldquo;Every pill and medication I&rsquo;ve received has only ended in my legs being swollen,&rdquo; Tsekeleke said.&ldquo;Consensus among doctors has been that I should consider chopping my leg, but I&rsquo;d rather die than lose it.&rdquo;Asked for comment, Mboro said Tsekeleke had landed at his The Incredible Happenings Church in the nick of time.&ldquo;For the next eight weeks, I&rsquo;ll be praying for people who have problems with their legs, arms and waist, and asking God for rain,&rdquo; Mboro said.And with Tsekeleke unable to dance or walk well, Mboro believed prayer might do the trick.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying I heal people, but I&rsquo;m saying God will help him,&rdquo; the prophet said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not claiming to have powers, I&rsquo;m just a person God uses to help people.&rdquo;
