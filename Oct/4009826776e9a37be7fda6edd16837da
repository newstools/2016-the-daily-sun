Community Based Development project believes that witchcraft exists and wants people, especially the youth, to be aware of it.The group of six members, who are between 21 to 31 years old, was formed last year to raise awareness.Bongani Mataka (30) from New Cross Roads, Gugulethu said: &ldquo;People are still in denial that this is something that is really happening. &ldquo;But it happens everywhere and people must be told about it. It has happened to me and to people I know. &ldquo;Some people are holding back my success because they are jealous of the things they know I might do for my family once I succeed. We started this organisation because we wanted to raise awareness. &ldquo;We also focus on art, dance and music programmes.&rdquo;Member Lungelo Xaba (31) said he has also experienced witchcraft. &ldquo;We know what we are talking about and we want other people to be aware of it too.&rdquo;
