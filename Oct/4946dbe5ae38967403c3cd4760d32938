ZANELE Makhaya, who stars on Mzansi Magic&rsquo;s Greed and Desire, has been accused of being a con artist!Three women claim the owner of online shop Diva Fabulous Zah, which sells fashionware, has been taking customers&rsquo; money without delivering the goods.Lerato Malepe (34), from Tshwane told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Zanele advertised her business on a WhatsApp group called Pretoria Ladies and Fashion.&ldquo;In July I ordered Adidas takkies and deposited R480 in her bank account. &ldquo;After she confirmed receiving the payment, I never heard from her again. Every time I call her she doesn&rsquo;t answer.&rdquo; Lefase Chokoe-Rankoe told the People&rsquo;s Paper she ordered two pairs of Puma shoes for R1 499 in April, but she was still waiting. &ldquo;If she cannot deliver the shoes, she must just return my money.&rdquo; Boitshoko Chipape said she also ordered takkies for R1 700 from Zanele, but she never received them. &ldquo;On Wednesday, I finally complained on her Facebook page and she ended up paying me back. Another woman told me Zanele owed her R2 000.&rdquo;When Daily Sun contacted Zanele, she confirmed she ran an online shop. &ldquo;The problem is that I&rsquo;ve been having problems with customs duty. I am working hard to make sure the stuff is delivered. &ldquo;I started my business in 2014 and I never had complaints until I appeared on TV. &ldquo;Since then people have been trying to bring me down. There&rsquo;s a lot of competition in the industry.&rdquo; But she promised to refund clients by the end of next week. &ldquo;Those who want their money back should let me know so I can refund them,&rdquo; said Zanele.
