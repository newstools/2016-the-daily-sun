SAFA&rsquo;s technical director Neil Tovey is making good progress on his recovery. The former Bafana Bafana captain was admitted to a Durban hospital on Sunday afternoon after suffering a heart attack while training. His brother, Mark, said doctors told the family that they were impressed by his progress.&ldquo;He is now able to sit on his own. He also walks unaided. And from where I am seated, I must say that we are really in a good space as opposed to the beginning of this week.&rdquo;Mark added that there was still a lot of rehabilitation to do before Tovey got back on his feet. Tovey suffered his first heart attack in February last year. The 54-year-old soccer legend made 52 appearances for Bafana and captained the national side on 29 occasions.Mark said he wanted to thank all South Africans for their goodwill gestures and prayers.&ldquo;Since he was admitted on Sunday, people across Mzansi have been sending wishes and prayers to Neil and the family.&rdquo; Tovey was appointed as Safa&rsquo;s technical director last June.
