THOUSANDS of Ndebele people from the Ndzundza tribe will march to the Union Buildings in Tshwane on Friday. The tribe wants President Jacob Zuma to give King Mabhoko III full kingship status. Princess Nomcebo Mahlangu, the co-ordinator of the march, said they want Zuma to reverse a decision he made after the Nhlapho Commission&rsquo;s report was released in 2012. The commission suggested the group fall under the leadership of the Mabena royal family.The decision means King Mabhoko III serves under King Makhosoke II.&ldquo;Our tribe is not happy with the decision. &ldquo;The commission said the royal status of the tribe will end once our current king dies. &ldquo;We do not accept that and we want the commission&rsquo;s decision to be reviewed,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We want to be given full kingship and will never accept being ruled by King Makhosonke II of the Manala tribe.&ldquo;The Ndebele people from the Ndzundza tribe have decided to tackle the issue head on because it undermines our status. &ldquo;We want our king to have the same status as other kings in the country. &ldquo;Our tribe also wants the royal family to have a budget.&rdquo; Princess Nomcebo said if the Xhosa people can have three kings, the Ndebele people should also be allowed to have more than one ruler. She said the Ndzundza and Manala cultures are different, which makes it impossible for them to have one leader. &ldquo;We will also march against the Imgoma Bill, which regulates initiation schools. &ldquo;Our king was not consulted when it was written. There are parts of the bill which go against our culture,&rdquo; said the princess.The marchers will gather at Church Square in Pretoria at 10am before making their way to the Union Buildings.
