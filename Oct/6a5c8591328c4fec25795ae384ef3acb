ONE of three Mthatha youths convicted of killing a teenage couple has committed suicide behind bars.The SunTeam has learned that the families of Carl George and Jacqui Miller were informed late last week that Mkhululi Luwaca (23) had hanged himself. Nkosinathi Breakfast, the provincial correctional services commissioner, confirmed the incident. He said Luwaca was found dead in his single cell at Mdantsane Correctional Facility in East London last Monday,&ldquo;He was in a cell in the special care unit at around 12pm after having lunch. &ldquo;The offender was incarcerated in a single cell because he was facing a further maximum juvenile charge. He used a torn sheet to hang himself. The incident has been reported to the police. It will also be investigated internally to see if there were any protocol breaches by our officials.&rdquo;Breakfast also said that Luwaca had been moved from Mthatha&rsquo;s Wellington Prison to Mdantsane, since protocol states that all juveniles must be kept at the East London- based facility.Luwaca had last appeared in the Mthatha High Court two weeks ago along with co- accused Bongani Dephana (20) and Andiphile Mhlophe (23) for sentencing argument, but it was postponed to 4 November. It was submitted that their lawyer was not ready for argument. Before he was convicted of murder, kidnapping and robbery with aggravating circumstances in July, Luwaca had missed an appearance in Mthatha because he was appearing in PE for another case.He was sentenced to 15 years in jail for rape on 2 June while he was waiting to be sentenced for the double murder.
