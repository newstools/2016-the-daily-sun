A SALON owner and a recycling business are at war over a heap of rubbish! Chicco Masiya told Daily Sun Klaas Mphane&rsquo;s nearby recycling business was chasing away his clients as the stench and flies from the rubbish heaped in front of his salon was unbearable. The 33-year-old from Madelakufa in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni said: &ldquo;The flies come into my salon as if there are dead animals here. &ldquo;My customers got disgusted and left because they felt the environment was unhygienic.&rdquo; Chicco said he had tried on many occasions to convince Klaas to move his business, but he threatened to attack him. &ldquo;He tells me I&rsquo;m a foreigner and I can&rsquo;t say anything because his vote allowed me to be in South Africa. He told me he will never move but I&rsquo;m not the only one complaining,&rdquo; he said.The owners of a nearby tavern and shisa nyama told the SunTeam their businesses were also suffering.Chicco said at one time he would come into his salon in the morning to find rats had destroyed his hair pieces and hair products. He claimed Klaas used to run his recycling business in the nearby squatter camp but residents kicked him out because of the rats. Klaas said he would never move because the money he made was supporting his family. &ldquo;That boy thinks he will get me out of the business but he won&rsquo;t. I will deal with anyone who gets in my way,&rdquo; said Klaas.
