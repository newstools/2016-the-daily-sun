RESIDENTS are terrified of a group of mentally ill men who are being kept in a house in their quiet suburb. The people of Amanda-sig in Tshwane told Daily Sun that they go to bed worried about the men staying at what appeared to be a private facility.One frustrated resident said sometimes the men stand at the windows asking for money for cigarettes and cold drinks.&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t give it to them, they insult you.&rdquo; When the SunTeam visited the area a worker at a nearby guest house said guests were also scared. A source at the facility said the patients&rsquo; social grants were being used to pay for their upkeep. A patient who appeared to be of sound mind warned female journalists to stay away because the men &ldquo;would rape them&rdquo;. &ldquo;At night they masturbate on the walls, so imagine how they feel.&rdquo;The facility was opened three months ago despite a recent announcement by Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu that the department will no longer be using any private mental hospitals. That announcement was made after Daily Sun reported that 36 psychiatric patients had died at Life Esidimeni, which had a contract with the health department. Steve Mabona, department of health spokesman, said: &ldquo;Yes, the facility is contracted to the health department. The department would like to give the health ombudsman an opportunity to finalise investigations.&rdquo; Ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba said a team would be investigating private mental health facilities.
