MORE skeletons are allegedly creeping out of Thabiso Kutumela&rsquo;s closet!Two weeks ago we reported allegations that the Bucs star was accused of abusing a girlfriend known as Kea. Now another woman has come forward. Tshwaledi Modiba claims Kutumela&rsquo;s been trying to force her to abort her baby. She claims she&rsquo;s two months pregnant with Kutumela&rsquo;s baby. The 23-year-old Limpopo woman said she&rsquo;s been dating the former Baroka FC player for a year. Tshwaledi said when Thabiso saw her chatting to another guy, he reported her to her family.&ldquo;He told my sister I&rsquo;m sleeping around,&rdquo; she said. Tshwaledi said they got back together, but she discovered there was another woman in his life. &ldquo;When I asked him, he said they&rsquo;re just friends.&ldquo;He told me I must cut ties with the other soccer player. I did it because I wanted to please him,&rdquo; she said. Tshwaledi said although he never abused her physically, he threatened her. &ldquo;He slept with me without a condom. I&rsquo;m the third lady he has asked to abort,&rdquo; she claimed. &ldquo;Last night he told me if I expose him, he&rsquo;s going to open a case at the police against me,&rdquo; Tshwaledi told the People&rsquo;s Paper. Kutumela said Tshwaledi is his ex. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a thing of the past. We had our issues and I&rsquo;ve moved on.&rdquo;
