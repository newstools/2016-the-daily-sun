THE Fire Tabernacle Prophetic Church was packed on Friday as Prophet France Marima prayed for the sick. Then the church structure and tent roof started shaking.The prophet went outside, but in a flash he was back shouting at the congregation to get out as doom was coming!The next moment a tornado ripped the church in two, sending the tent roof flying!Mercifully no one was injured.France said he heard the wild storm approaching. He stopped praying and went outside, where he saw a black cloud coming staright for his church.&ldquo;I rushed back to tell the congregation to leave. The next thing was I saw my church being torn in two pieces.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen such a thing in my life. The church collapsed in front of my eyes.&ldquo;The tent flew up like a rocket into the sky.&rdquo; Marima said it was the third tornado to strike the church in as many years.&ldquo;This is a devil attacking my church. How else can you explain what has happened for three consecutive years in October?&rdquo; he asked.He added that the damage was estimated at about R500 000. &ldquo;Through God&rsquo;s grace we will overcome this. &ldquo;It will not distract us. We will continue praising our God, who knows our destination.&rdquo;
