TAKATSO Mphela (21) has been reunited with her long lost purse, thanks to Good Samaritan Lucky Bokaba and Daily Sun. Last Thursday, the People&rsquo;s Paper ran a story about Lucky, from Tembisa, who found the purse while walking along Hlongwane Street in Phomolong section on his way to his mother&rsquo;s place.Takatso&rsquo;s mother, Mmasentle Mphela, saw the article and phoned the paper to say the purse belonged to her daughter.After fetching the purse from Lucky, Daily Sun had it delivered to Takatso at her mother&rsquo;s house in Birchleigh, Ekurhuleni.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe there are still good people like Lucky in this world. I have no words to thank him and every single person who made it possible for me to get my purse back. &ldquo;Daily Sun is the bomb!&rdquo; said excited Takatso. Takatso said she was the victim of a smash and grab in Kempton Park. She said: &ldquo;I had stopped at a red traffic light when I heard my back window break. Before I knew it, my purse was gone.&ldquo;I only had about R50 in my purse and my ID, driver&rsquo;s licence, store cards and bank cards. They took the money and left everything else as it was. I never thought I&rsquo;d get my valuables back!&rdquo;
