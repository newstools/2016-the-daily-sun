SUN CITY was ablaze early this morning after prisoners set dustbins alight at the Joburg prison.Alarms reportedly went off at 6am.According to a source, a clash between inmates and warders led to the burning of dustbins by angry prisoners. The warder claimed the inmates were angered by warders trying to remove their TV sets, saying it was a violation of their rights.&ldquo;I was really scared. The inmates were aggressive and really caught us off guard. &ldquo;They were smart and waited for the gates to unlock before seizing the moment,&rdquo; said a shaken warder.He added that offenders were making a habit of burning prisons in order to get attention. &ldquo;Calm has been restored. The perpetrators of the violence will not get away with this. People could have burnt to death.&rdquo;Correctional Services&rsquo; spokesman Manelisi Wolela said the offenders set dustbins alight in the courtyard of the Medium B male section, but the officials extinguished the fire before any great damage was done.&ldquo;There were no injuries or deaths, and no cells were damaged. Some offenders are being inspected for possible smoke inhalation. The situation is under control.&rdquo;Wolela added that a prisoner count was conducted afterwards to ensure everyone was accounted for. &ldquo;Correctional services officials will hold talks with the inmates to discuss the reasons for their unacceptable behaviour,&rdquo; Wolela said.He said internal disciplinary processes would be instituted and criminal charges brought against those found to be responsible for the fire.
