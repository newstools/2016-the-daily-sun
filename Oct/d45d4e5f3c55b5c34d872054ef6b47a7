THE bicycle thug has been terrorising residents for quiet some time, but he met his match when he came across Thuli Yende (47).Thuli was on her way from Dunnotar to her house in KwaThema, Ekurhuleni when the armed thug tried to rob her on Monday.With the gun in her face, Thuli could either surrender or die &ndash; but the brave mum decided to fight back. She hit the surprised thug with her head and they both fell to the ground.&ldquo;I climbed on top of him. We fought over the gun,&rdquo; said Thuli.&ldquo;I knew he wanted to kill me so I grabbed a rock and hit him in the face. &ldquo;I made sure I focused on hitting his face and head with the rock so he would be powerless.&rdquo;Thuli disarmed the thug.&ldquo;I screamed and residents came to help me,&rdquo; she said.The thug managed to escape, leaving behind his 9mm gun, bicycle and cellphone. She handed the items to the Dunnotar police. They are looking for the man.&ldquo;When I got home I started shaking when I realised what I had done. God gave me the power to fight that man. When I told my boyfriend what had happened, he couldn&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;Mzwakhe Ntaba, a victim of the bicycle thug, said: &ldquo;There were seven of us when the bicycle thug made us lie on the ground. We were afraid to fight back but she did it alone.&rdquo;
