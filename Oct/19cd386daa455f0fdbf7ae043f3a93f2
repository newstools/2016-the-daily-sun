FOUR years ago, Daily Sun first reported on how pupils of a mud school wished for a proper building for Christmas. After a number of stories were published, pupils and staff at Zwelihlangene Primary School finally got their Christmas wish. Last month, the school in Nothanaza Village, near Mount Frere, started having classes in 10 brand new classrooms. The school also received a proper staff room with a kitchen area, where the nutrition programme food is now cooked. In November 2012, the People s Paper reported the school only had two mud classrooms, which were overcrowded. Teacher Funeka Sikwatikwati thanked the People s Paper for fighting for the school. Our school was a shame. We had no classrooms and our attempts to get help failed so many times until you visited, said the teacher. Four water tanks were installed at the school, meaning children and staff no longer have to go to a local stream for water. The school was also provided with new toilets. Eastern Cape Education Department spokesman Loyiso Pulumani said the school was one of many that were included in an improvement plan over the past eight years. He said his department was continuing with its programme to make mud schools a thing of the past. He congratulated the school and called on the teachers to work hard to make sure pupils got better marks.
