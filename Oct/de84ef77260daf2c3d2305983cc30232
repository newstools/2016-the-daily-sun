Golden Arrows coach Clinton Larsen has bemoaned his side's inability to close out games after the disappointment of seeing them held to a 2-2 draw by 10-man Maritzburg United on Friday.Larsen's table-toppers appeared to be heading for a straightforward victory in the KwaZulu Natal derby, having forged a two-goal cushion in the first half.Goals from Kagiso Dikgacoi (18') and Musa Bilankulu (35') put Arrows firmly in the driving seat, before Evans Rusike scored on the stroke of half-time to give the Team of Choice a way back into the contest.Brian Madela received his marching orders in the 59th minute after picking up his second yellow card of the game, but Maritzburg battled on valiantly and eventually drew level in the 71st minute, skipper Kurt Lentjies bagging the all-important goal.And, despite having an extra man for just over half an hour, Abafana Bes'thende were unable to find a third goal as they were forced to settle for a share of the spoils."We expected our experienced players to put a foot on the ball and stretch this team seeing that they were a man down but we didn't do that and we allowed them back into the game and it became open - both teams were just going for it in the end," Larsen told Supersport."That [a lack of composure] has been our Achilles heel this season and hence we brought someone like KG [Kagisho Dikgacoi] in and we're going to continue to get him involved to get the match fitness up. He took his goal very well today."We miss the decision-making from players like him but it is an area we will keep working on." -Teamtalk Media
