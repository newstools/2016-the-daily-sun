MINISTER of Sport and Recreation Fikile &ldquo;Father Christmas&rdquo; Mbalula was at it again!Mbalula, who earned the title of Father Christmas for the cash bonuses he handed over to Paralympic medalists earlier this year, splurged R700 000 to Mamelodi Sundowns for their successful campaign in the CAF Champions League.The Brazilians were crowned the Champs of Africa on Sunday after defeating Egyptian giants Zamalek 3-1 on aggregate.&nbsp;Sundowns arrived this morning at the OR Tambo International Airport, where they were welcomed by a multitude of supporters.&nbsp;Mbalula said; &ldquo;We thank Mr Motsepe for making us proud. The champions are not respected while seating, we want to see you on top of an open bus, so that we can cherish your success accordingly. We do not roll out red carpet for mediocrity but we roll it out for champions.&nbsp;&ldquo;I may not have the same money as Motsepe but I have a cheque on me, it is not a big one. It is a very small cheque, I am giving you all 700 000. And you will all share it even those who didn&rsquo;t play because you are a team.&rdquo;Mbalula also challenged Kaizer Chiefs and SuperSport United to replicate what Sundowns did by going to Africa and conquer it.&ldquo;Bobby Motaung (Chiefs) and SuperSport United I urge you to try to reach where Sundowns have reached. Don&rsquo;t go there to compete and then get eliminated early.&nbsp;&ldquo;Orlando Pirates won in 1995 under National Soccer League (NSL) and Sundowns have won under the Premier Soccer League, so you also can make the nation proud.&rdquo;The Brazilians players and technical team can look forward bonus money of $1.5million (R21million) prize money for winning the competition.
