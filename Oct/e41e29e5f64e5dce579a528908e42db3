Yvonne Chaka Chaka&rsquo;s son, Mfumo Mhinga, has driven himself into heaps of trouble. According to court papers, he was arrested in Fourways last week Friday for allegedly driving under the influence. Police say he refused to take a breathalyser test or have his blood drawn. Upon arrest, Mfumo then allegedly tried to bribe his way out of trouble. And when finally nabbed, he allegedly escaped from custody but was soon caught. Following his stint behind bars for a few hours, Mfumo was released on bail. He then appeared in the Randburg Magistrate&rsquo;s Court on Monday, but was thrown back in the holding cells. Mfumo faces charges of drunken driving, resisting arrest, defeating the ends of justice and escaping from police custody. His legal team said it would try to have the charges withdrawn, arguing discrepancy in the case. Yvonne said she was not aware about his arrest. Mfumo denied that he was arrested. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true,&rdquo; he said.
