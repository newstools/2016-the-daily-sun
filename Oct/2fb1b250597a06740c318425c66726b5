ORIEL Mufamadi (39) from Meadowlands wants his baby mama locked up. The 39-year-old said he dumped his girlfriend of eight years, but she always comes back to steal and harass him. &ldquo;She broke into my house four times this year. I opened two cases and she was arrested only once. She spent just two days in police cells.&rdquo;Oriel said when they fought last December she went back to live with her parents. &ldquo;In March she came to my house and broke the door. She took all the furniture, including the beds.&rdquo; Oriel said after that his baby mama left Gauteng for Venda. She was arrested when she got back. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been coming and terrorising me since March. I don&rsquo;t love her anymore. I want police to help me get this woman behind bars.&rdquo;Last Thursday, while Oriel was at work, the baby mama allegedly struck again. &ldquo;She took all my personal stuff, including my ID. I went to her house and found all my belongings there.&rdquo; Oriel said when he went to the police to report the incident they threatened to arrest him. &ldquo;They told me she had a protection order against me which I&rsquo;d never seen nor signed.&rdquo; &ldquo;If it happens again and I find her at my place I will take the law into my hands. I have no protection from the law even after I found my stuff at her place. The cops tell me I have no witnesses. What should I do?&rdquo; Kay Makhubela, Gauteng&rsquo;s provincial police spokesman, confirmed that Meadowlands police are investigating a case of house-breaking and theft.
