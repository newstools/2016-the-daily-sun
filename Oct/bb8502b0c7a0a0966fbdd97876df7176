JOSEPH Masinya was busy with his day to day duties when he saw something hanging from a tree! The 54-year-old gardener at Cosmo City West Primary School, Joburg said when he got closer he realised that it was a man. He had used a shoelace to hang himself. &ldquo;In all the 10 years I have been helping at this school I have never seen anything like this. &ldquo;In fact I&rsquo;ve never seen a dead man hanging in a tree except in movies. But, of all places that one could do this, why a schoolyard? &ldquo;This is going to traumatise the little ones a lot. I&rsquo;m not even sure if the children will be able to come into this yard.&rdquo; He said it was about 9am when he discovered the body that appeared to be that of a young man in his 30s. &ldquo;He was wearing a green top, red T-shirt, black track pants and red Nike takkies.&rdquo; Some residents around the school were not convinced that the man died from hanging himself with a shoelace. One resident at the scene said it was totally impossible for a shoelace to hold that weight.&ldquo;This person weighs a lot. &ldquo;The shoelace would have snapped on the spot if he had really used it to hang himself.&ldquo;I believe there is somebody behind this horrible action.&rdquo; None of the residents recognised the dead man and believe that he was from another section of Cosmo City.Honeydew police said they are looking for family members or anyone who might assist them to identify the man.An inquest has been opened and police are investigating the matter.
