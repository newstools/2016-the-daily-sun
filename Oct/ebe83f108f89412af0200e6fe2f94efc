THE GOGO has been blessed with a long life but that is exactly why she is so unhappy.&nbsp; For the last 13 years she has wanted her life to end&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;. and there&rsquo;s a reason why.&nbsp; I HAVE SEEN HEAVEN AND I WANT TO GO BACK THERE, SHE SAID.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw three angels at the gate and I knew that is where I wanted to stay. &ldquo;It was a place beautiful beyond my imaging. I was sad when the Lord sent me back to earth. In heaven I was healthy,&rdquo; said Anna Mtshwaeni (101), of Atteridgeville, Tshwane. This happened in 2003, when her family thought she was dead.&nbsp; While gogo Anna believed she was in heaven, her son, Jonas Mahlangu (55) was on earth mourning for his mother. He said he won&rsquo;t ever forget the awful morning of 7 August 2003 when he went to wake Anna up and she didn&rsquo;t respond. &ldquo;She was cold. She wasn&rsquo;t breathing,&rdquo; he said. He called his relatives and when the elders came they told him to make sure she was really dead before calling a mortuary van. &ldquo;I sat at my mother&rsquo;s side for the whole day and night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I held her in my arms and I finally realised she was really gone.&rdquo; But when the mortuary van arrived the next morning, the driver shouted at him to come and see. &ldquo;He told me that my mother was breathing.&rdquo; He said he called a friend and they rushed his mother to Kalafong Hospital. He said she was still cold when she was admitted to hospital but two days later she was released. &ldquo;The neighbours were shocked because word of her death had spread.&rdquo; Gogo Anna said she clearly remembers her short visit to heaven.&nbsp; She said the gates of heaven were guarded by three angels. &ldquo;The strongest angel had the Holy Bible in his right hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I walked into heaven between the angels and continued into a beautiful city until I saw God&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; She said God was in a garden outside. &ldquo;When God looked at me, his eyes were so powerful, with a light like fire, that I had to look away.&nbsp; &ldquo;He spoke to me and then He sent me back to earth.&nbsp; &ldquo;God brought me back to pray for the people of the earth. He said I should read Isaiah 22.&rdquo;&nbsp; A nurse at the hospital said she remembers gogo Anna very well. &ldquo;She is still our patient. I remember her because her son was so stressed when she was admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think she slipped into a coma and back. We were shocked by what they told us had happened to her.&rdquo;&nbsp;
