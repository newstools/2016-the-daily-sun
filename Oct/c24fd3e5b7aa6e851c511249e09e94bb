FROM against all odds to aluta continua!That is how Pitso Mosimane described their Caf Champions League victory on Sunday night. He said they won the trophy against all odds &ndash; after overcoming all the obstacles they had to face in the lead-up to the final. The Mamelodi Sundowns coach will not rest on his laurels after winning this trophy. Mosimane may have achieved yet another milestone in his coaching career when he led Sundowns to the Champions League title on Sunday &ndash; but he wants more. &ldquo;Jingles&rdquo;, who has won all the trophies on offer in the PSL &ndash; Absa Premiership, Telkom Knockout, Top 8 and Nedbank &ndash; said the continental trophy was long overdue. &ldquo;That was the one left and I had to win it as a coach. It means a lot to me,&rdquo; said Mosimane.He said the secret to winning the Champions League was to win home games: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t come here and look for results. You should win at home. We won all our matches at home and tried not to lose away. I believe any team that plays in the Champions League or Confederation Cup pays the price. &ldquo;We lost the league previously and the Nedbank Cup, and dropped two points against Maritzburg City, but it paid off.&rdquo; Mosimane said Sundowns&rsquo; loss to Bidvest Wits in the MTN8 final was a wake-up call for them: &ldquo;Thanks, Bidvest, for giving us a wake-up call. We were a little humbled. We knew how to defend today because of that game.&rdquo;He said next on their menu was the Fifa Club World Cup in Japan. He added: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find out how we fare in global football. We will know where we are (in terms of progress) because we will be playing against continental champions.&rdquo;He said he was happy they would be avoiding the big guns in the preliminary rounds of the Caf Champions League next year. &ldquo;We always play on the offensive and try to hold on to the ball as much as we can. We don&rsquo;t know how to defend. This was the only game that pushed us so deep, we had our backs against the wall.&rdquo; He said it would have been nice to win the game here but he would accept the defeat. &ldquo;I am not happy that we lost the game but we lifted the trophy, so let&rsquo;s sit back and absorb that fact.&rdquo;
