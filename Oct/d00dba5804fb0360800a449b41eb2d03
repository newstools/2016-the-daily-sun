THATO Monedi got the shock of his life recently when he arrived home from work. His landlord had thrown all his belongings onto the street &ndash; and the community looted some of the items. Now the 31-year-old wants his landlord to pay. According to Thato, Lerumo Mthupa of Naledi, Soweto kicked him out without giving notice or any time to look for another place. &ldquo;This man has cost me belongings worth more than R7 000. He threw all my belongings out in the street,&rdquo; an angry Thato said.He said he paid R1 200 a month and had never given any problems with his rent.&ldquo;I do not know why he is treating me like this. He could have at least given me notice or sat me down instead of throwing my stuff onto the street. Now my sound system, TV and studio equipment have been stolen. &ldquo;I want him to pay because he threw my stuff out on the street,&rdquo; Thato said.Daily Sun contacted Lerumo, who said: &ldquo;That man is talking rubbish. This is my house and I won&rsquo;t be told what to do by an outsider. He knows very well why I kicked him out. He would just come home with his friends and throw parties, playing loud music throughout the night &ndash; and I live with my gogo, who is very old. &ldquo;I warned him several times. &ldquo;I did what I had to do.&rdquo;Naledi police spokesman person Molefe Mokoena said the only recourse Thato has would be to take the matter to the Small Claims Court.
