MOTORISTS hooted as they passed the naked man walking along the highway. But the man continued to walk down the N1 in Bloemfontein without a care in the world.He switched from one lane into another while heading towards Colesberg on Friday. He was saved by cops after the SunTeam called for help. When police arrived, he changed to the oncoming lane and played cat and mouse games before being caught by the cops.The man did not say anything when construction workers insulted him.One of the workers shouted: &ldquo;You fool! &ldquo;You are embarrassing us when you walk around like that. &ldquo;Who did you anger? &ldquo;You must apologise to them so this spell can be reversed. &ldquo;You are lucky to be under police guard. &ldquo;We would have taught you a lesson if they weren&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;At first the construction workers thought the man was mute, but he started to talk when the cops arrived.&ldquo;I am not crazy. &ldquo;Leave me alone. &ldquo;I just want to reach my destination!&rdquo; he said.Parkweg police spokeswoman Constable Wendy Nkabi said: &ldquo;The man was taken to Pelonomi Hospital for a medical checkup. &ldquo;We will investigate where he comes from. &ldquo;No case was opened.&rdquo;
