WHILE farmers and residents across Mzansi cheered as rains started to fall following months of drought, Mother Nature also brought misery.On Friday night, over 1 000 people were left homeless after heavy rains and a strong wind damaged 100 homes around Ladysmith in the KZN Midlands.Affected families from Roosboom, Acaciaville, Steadville and St Chads were forced to seek refuge at their neighbours homes.Gcwalisile Ngubeni (33) said a huge portion of her five-roomed family house collapsed. The roof was ripped off and blown away while we were inside. Luckily, no one was hurt but we ve been left with nothing. Our belongings, including furniture and food, were destroyed. On Saturday, we managed to cover one of the damaged rooms with a tent to stay dry. We are five and it will be difficult for neighbours to accommodate us, she sobbed.Alfred Duma mayor Vincent Madlala said the Uthukela Municipality and disaster management officials were visiting victims homes. At some homes, only roofs were ripped off, but other houses had completely collapsed. Madlala said efforts were being made to temporarily assist victims while the provincial government was expected to suggest a permanent solution.Co-operative governance and traditional affairs MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube urged residents to be extra careful as these incidents are common at this time of year. Global warming is causing unpredictable weather patterns. Our province is a high risk area. Communities should take precautionary measures guided by weather alerts, said Dube-Ncube.She added that many people were taken to their nearest healthcare facilities after sustaining injuries, but no lives were lost.
