EASTERN Cape pupils, matrics included, have been admitted to hospital after eating umvubo. More than 800 pupils from seven schools around King William&rsquo;s Town have been affected.All the pupils ate umvubo, a mix of amasi and umphokoqo. It came from a farm in Stutterheim. The departments of health and education said a message would be sent to all schools in the area not to give school children umvubo or amasi until further notice. The kids started falling ill on Monday and yesterday more were admitted to Greys Hospital and Bhisho Hospital.Eastern Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle, education MEC Mandla Makupula and health MEC Phumza Dyantyi visited the pupils in hospital yesterday morning.Masualle said it seems an item on the menu was contaminated. Tests are being done to verify this. He said: &ldquo;I am very happy that the kids are out of danger.&rdquo; He added that government would visit the suppliers and take appropriate action. Dyantyi said a team was investigating the dairy products supplied to the schools. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re also taking water samples at affected schools,&rdquo; she said. Jali High School pupil Yolanda Soldaat (20) is in grade 12. She said she ate umvubo at 10am before the exams started on Wednesday. &ldquo;The exams started late because the papers arrived late. &ldquo;As I was writing, I got stomach cramps. &ldquo;I was about to start the third section of my paper when saliva started pouring from my mouth and I vomited umvubo. &ldquo;Later I vomited blood. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so disappointed. &ldquo;I had hoped to pass this paper with good marks.&rdquo; Makupula said the names of the affected pupils would be communicated to the national basic education department and the Umalusi council. &ldquo;We will discuss what happened and find alternative options. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not exactly sure of the number of the matric pupils that have been affected.&rdquo;
