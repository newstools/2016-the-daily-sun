Dear PastorMy marriage of eight years is not working out. My wife left with my kids four months ago. We always argued about trivial stuff.She would pack and leave me but come back a few days later. However, this time around she has failed to do so. Pastor, please pray for the healing and restoration of my marriage.TshepisoDear TshepisoMarital success requires hard work from both partners. Begin the journey of winning your wife back today. You need to pray aggressively and believe that God will answer your prayer. Pray as if everything depends upon prayer. Then forgive her and also forgive yourself for all your transgressions. Decide to transform yourself because we cannot expect things to change while we continue to do the same things we were doing when things fell apart. The Bible tells us that love conquers all. I urge you to pursue her with love. You should date again and propose to her again, and recommit to her. As a man of God, I stand in prayer to rebuke any wicked spirit assigned to interfere with your marriage in Jesus&rsquo; name.
