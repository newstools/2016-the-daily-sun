Over the past weekend musicians and A-list celebrities from across the continent came together to celebrate African music.&nbsp; The MTV Africa Music Awards was held in Johannesburg at the Ticket Pro Dome on Saturday night, and the red carpet was the biggest one we&rsquo;ve seen so far. Some celebs came and had their moments and others should have just stayed at home.&nbsp; I will be sharing what I thought &nbsp;of the fashion, from the MAMA&rsquo;s red carpet of some of our local celebs.&nbsp;ALSO READ: WHO WORE IT BEST?&nbsp;1.Babes Wodumo:&nbsp;Babes Wodumo. Photo by Lucky NxumaloThis is where strategic thinking about your brand and image is so important for a public figure. This outfit does not fit with Babes brand and image. I don&rsquo;t like this look.&nbsp;2.Nomuzi Mabena:Nomuzi Mabena. Photo by Lucky NxumaloNomuzi really has a style of her own and I am learning to accept that, but, this look really is not working. I really don&rsquo;t understand the flaps/peplum by her hips; I also think she could have chosen better shoes.&nbsp;3.Thando Thabethe:Thando Thabethe. Photo by Lucky NxumaloI love Thando&rsquo;s red carpet&rsquo;s looks, but this one, omg! What happen Thando? This is just so wrong on so many levels, everything about it is just so wrong.&nbsp;4.Noluthando Meje:Noluthando Meje. Photo by Lucky NxumaloMy gosh!!!! What on earth was she thinking? This is just hideous, I don&rsquo;t know how else to describe it. From her make-up down to her shoes, it&rsquo;s just awful.&nbsp;5.Somizi:Somizi. Photo by Lucky NxumaloAhhhhh, I don&rsquo;t like this look. This suit is not fitted properly, I don&rsquo;t like the shoes, I don&rsquo;t like the bow tie. It&rsquo;s a No for me.&nbsp;6.Ntando Duma:Ntando Duma. Photo by Lucky NxumaloThis is a very beautiful dress, but for the MAMA&rsquo;s is doesn&rsquo;t work. Ntando is a very hip young girl, for a music award show I think she could have dressed super fun.&nbsp;7.Cassper Nyovest:Cassper Nyovest. Photo by Lucky Nxumalo Cassper choose to go with the clean formal look. He looks very different, he got rid of his hairpiece and he has lost a lot of weight. But I don&rsquo;t like the suit, the fabric and print just does not look nice.&nbsp;8.Khanyi Mbau:Khanyi Mbau. Photo by Lucky Nxumalo I absolutely love this look. Khanyi looks fun and is on trend, with her faux fur and clear block heels. She did expose her booty which I didn&rsquo;t like, but if it wasn&rsquo;t for that this look would have been my favourite.&nbsp;9.Dineo Moeketsi:Dineo Moeketsi. Photo by Lucky NxumaloLove, love, love this outfit. I think Dineo is underrated as a style icon in Mzansi. For a music award show this is proper, she has her gold chocker, the white ruffles, she&rsquo;s on trend and she had the best accessory by her side, she sexy man Solo matching in All White.&nbsp;10.Boity Thulo:Boity. Photo by Lucky NxumaloI don&rsquo;t like this look, I don&rsquo;t like the see through sheer jumpsuit, I think it&rsquo;s tacky. I also don&rsquo;t like the velvet material.&nbsp;11.Minnie Dlamini:Minnie Dlamini. Photo by Lucky NxumaloThis is PERFECT! Complete jaw drop moment. The structure of the blazer, her legs, the shoes, her hair, it all works. She looks so good. One of my favourite looks.&nbsp;12.Riky Rick:Riky Rick. Photo by Lucky NxumaloDoes Riky get paid to wear all the Gucci? And why is he carrying a handbag? I do like this look, it reminds me of those Phat Farm tracksuits, take away the handbag, it&rsquo;s a nice look for Riky. &nbsp;
