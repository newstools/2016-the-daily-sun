BIDVEST Wits head coach Gavin Hunt is thrilled that his star midfielder Daine Klate has been recalled to Bafana Bafana for their crucial 2018 World Cup qualifier against Senegal in Polokwane on 12 November.Surprisingly Klate, one of the best players Mzansi has produced, has only 13 Bafana caps to his name after a stellar club career. His last Bafana cap came on 7 September 2014 when he came on as late substitute in the 4-1 World Cup win over Botswana in Durban.Said Hunt: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really pleased for him. Klate should have had 50 caps by now. He more than deserves his call-up. He has been an outstanding player for all the clubs he has played for.&rdquo;Klate (31) is the most decorated player in Mzansi, winning every domestic trophy on offer. He played a Man-of-the-Match role in helping the Clever Boys win the MTN8 trophy earlier this month.Klate will be travelling to the Free State capital when the Clever Boys face Bloemfontein Celtic in their third away trip in seven days at the Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium tomorrow (8.15pm).Hunt&rsquo;s men returned to Joburg yesterday after scoring a 2-1 win over struggling Ajax Cape Town to keep their unbeaten record in the Absa Premiership intact after four rounds.Said Hunt: &ldquo;The travelling up and down the country is tough on the players. But we have to keep going.&rdquo;Hunt was delighted with the Students&rsquo; fightback against the Urban Warriors after trailing 1-0 at half-time. He said: &ldquo;We were flat in the first half but showed character in the second.&rdquo; Hunt stressed that he expected a similar battle against Celtic, who are also struggling, and he indicated he might rotate his side.&ldquo;Celtic will be another tough nut to crack. But I have a bunch of fighters and the right sort of players in my squad.&rdquo;
