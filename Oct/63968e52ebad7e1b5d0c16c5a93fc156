&ldquo;I CAN&rsquo;T provide for my family because of my ID horror.&rdquo; These were the words of James Ngobeni (39), from Kliptown in Soweto. He told Daily Sun he was unable to get his life on track because he shared an ID number with a person in Mpumalanga he had never met. &ldquo;To make matters worse, I was arrested for supposedly being a foreigner even though I was born and bred in South Africa,&rdquo; said James. He told the SunTeam his problem started when he received a letter from Sars saying he owed them R24 954. &ldquo;They even issued a warrant for my arrest. &ldquo;I went to Home Affairs in Germiston, Ekurhuleni to find out what the problem was,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was told my ID had been duplicated. They told me to come back with a clinic card and an affidavit from my mum saying I&rsquo;m South African.&rdquo;James said he took the documents to Home Affairs and was told they would be forwarded to Tshwane. &ldquo;When I went to check on their progress I was told I was a Zimbabwean living here illegally and taken to Germiston Police Station. I was released after my mum fought with them for two days.&rdquo; Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola took James&rsquo; details and said the department&rsquo;s Gauteng manager would contact him to investigate and resolve the issue.
