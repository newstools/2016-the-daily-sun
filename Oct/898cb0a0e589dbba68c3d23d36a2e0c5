THE girlfriend of Luthando Siyoni, who has turned state witness in the murder case of Jayde Panayiotou, told the court he asked her to count a large amount of money in his gym bag. The money was allegedly paid to her boyfriend to kill Jayde last April.Siyoni&rsquo;s girlfriend of five years, Babalwa Breakfast, testified in the Port Elizabeth High Court yesterday.Jayde&rsquo;s husband Christopher is accused of paying his employee Luthando to hire hitmen Sizwezakhe Vumazonke, Sinethemba Nemembe and Zolani Sibeko to kidnap and murder his wife.Babalwa told the court: &ldquo;We went to his house. Then he went out, leaving his gym bag behind. Before he returned, I looked in the bag and saw the money.&ldquo;I asked him about the money when he got back. He told me he collected it from the gym and at work. He claimed the money would be used to renovate the gym. He then asked me to count the money and divide it into three separate piles. I did that and stuffed it into three socks.&rdquo;Prosecutor Marius Stander said: &ldquo;I am worried about the witness because she has started to contradict her affidavit. If she keeps changing her testimony, she might be found guilty of an offence.&rdquo; Advocate Terry Price, Christopher&rsquo;s lawyer, said he felt sorry for the witness. &ldquo;But does the law allow her to get legal representation once she is sworn in as a witness? She is changing her story, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean she is lying now. Maybe her affidavit was a lie. The only option the State has is to stop asking questions or declare her a hostile witness.&rdquo;
