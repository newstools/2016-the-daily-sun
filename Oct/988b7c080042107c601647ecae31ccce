Kaizer Chiefs will be looking to build on their recent good league form with a victory over Maritzburg United in a Telkom Knockout first-round game at the FNB Stadium on Saturday.The match kicks off at 20H15 and will see the two coaches - Steve Komphela of Chiefs, and Maritzburg's Ernst Middendorp, both up against their former clubs.The two teams have already met in the league, Amakhosi recording a 2-0 home victory over the KZN side.The Glamour Boys, who lost last season's TKO final 3-1 to Mamelodi Sundowns, are currently on a red-hot run of form, having put their early season struggles behind them with a four-match winning streak.Not so for the Team of Choice, who after a positive start to the season have gone five matches without victory.But Komphela won't be taking anything for granted, understanding the difference between league form and the unpredictable nature of cup competition."Form is something that inspires you, but it&rsquo;s a different competition, it&rsquo;s a once off thing," he said."A victory can be very deceptive - you might think everything is intact. We need to manage the inside pressure, there has to be harmony because on the back of harmony you get good team spirit and you get results."When you are playing in the league it is different because you know you have 30 rounds. When you are facing a knockout competition, it&rsquo;s do or die."You have a situation where you only have one shot, one bullet to hit this monster, if you miss you are gone, you start to shake and shiver and we don't want to get into that mode," he concluded.Kaizer Chiefs will be without midfielder George Maluleka, who is suspended, but otherwise have a clean bill of health.There are still question marks over the match fitness of Maritzburg striker Andrea Fillecia, but other than that, Middendorp also has all his players available.
