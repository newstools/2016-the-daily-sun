THE family of an 84-year-old man was traumatised after he was killed in an apparent hit on Wednesday afternoon. Dozens of onlookers gathered outside the house of the taxi owner in Sharpeville&rsquo;s Vuka kasi, in the Vaal, to witness the body being removed. The victim was reportedly followed to his home and shot dead minutes after he drove into his yard. He was unpacking his boot after a visit to town when an unknown man stormed into the yard and several gunshots were heard. Police spokesman Captain Teboho Lephoto told the SunTeam the identity of the gunman was unknown as no one saw him after the shooting. &ldquo;We only know that the victim was shot in his yard. We don&rsquo;t know what kind of car the killer was driving. However, investigations are underway,&rdquo; said Lephoto.&ldquo;We will only be able to confirm how many bullets killed the man after the post mortem examination.&rdquo; When asked about the motive for the crime, Lephoto said the police were yet to confirm whether it was a case of taxi violence. &ldquo;We are investigating the murder but we cannot confirm or deny it was a taxi hit.&rdquo; A case of murder was opened at the cop shop. &ldquo;No suspect has been arrested yet. Members of the community who might have information should come forward. &ldquo;We appeal to those who were close to the house at the time of the murder to anonymously give information to the nearest police station.&rdquo;
