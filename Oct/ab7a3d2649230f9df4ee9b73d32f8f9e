Award-winning musician Thandiswa Mazwai&rsquo;s wait for the right person is finally over. Sunday Sun can reveal the Ndilinde hitmaker is off the market. This was after she got engaged to her long-term partner, known as Anika. The Zabalaza hitmaker and her live-in lover decided to take their relationship to the next level. A close source said the engaged couple stays together in Parkhurst, Joburg, with Thandiswa&rsquo;s teenage daughter. According to the source, the two are serious about their relationship. Months ago, after their engagement, Sunday Sun learned Anika&rsquo;s family flew all the way from India to bring Thandiswa gifts and to congratulate the couple. The source said their families knew each other, got along very well and were liberal. &ldquo;Thandiswa and Anika have been through thick and thin together,&rdquo; the source said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been together and living like a married couple, so they might as well make it official.&rdquo; The source said the couple got engaged early this year, and &ldquo;they wear their rings as a symbol of their love&rdquo;. Another source said the wedding would likely take place overseas. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve travelled the world together and even lived abroad together, so it&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re likely going to have their wedding at some exotic island because they are also a private couple,&rdquo; the second source said. &ldquo;Thandiswa doesn&rsquo;t like the media.&rdquo; Both Thandiswa and Anika could not be reached for comment. The people who answered Thandiswa&rsquo;s phone on three different occasions said she went out and left the phone.
