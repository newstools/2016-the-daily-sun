The person agreed to meet with us to hand over his phone, but that won&rsquo;t be enough. We still don&rsquo;t know where Obed is.&rdquo;Mum Katherine Ngele said her son had not been well for some time.&ldquo;He told us before that he suffered from pain in his stomach that would not stop. My son is also hard of hearing.

His girlfriend refused to meet with Daily Sun after several attempts.Rabasotho police station spokeswoman Constable Patricia Mngijima confirmed that a missing person&rsquo;s case was opened.
