MAMELODI Sundowns have registered their first Absa Premiership defeat of the season after going down 2-1 to Cape Town City at Loftus Versfeld yesterday.&nbsp; The newly crowned Caf Champions League winners have yet to taste victory in the league this season.&nbsp; They are at the bottom of the standings on one point from two games.&nbsp; Sundowns are, however, playing catch-up in the league as yesterday&rsquo;s encounter are only their second so far due to their successful Caf competition commitments.&nbsp; Coach Pitso Mosimane relied on new recruits Thapelo Morena and Sibusiso Vilakazi to do the job, but City were just too strong for a somewhat rusty-looking Downs.&nbsp; The Tshwane based team were without regulars Dennis Onyango, Bangaly Soumahoro, Anthony Laffor, Keagan Dolly, Leo Castro and Yannik Zakri, who are all injured.&nbsp; The visiting side broke the ice in the 15th minute when Lebogang Manyama tapped in following a square pass from teammate Aubrey Ngoma.&nbsp; Sundowns immediately launched a counter-attack, seeking to bounce back, but a fatigued Khama Billiat was unable to find the target.&nbsp; Eric Tinkler&rsquo;s charges were all over Sundowns, looking more refreshed than their opponents, with Manyama nearly banging in his second in the 36th minute, only to see his shot miss Kennedy Mweene&rsquo;s goalmouth.&nbsp; There seemed to be a lot of space between Sundowns players in the first stanza, but they returned rejuvenated in the second half and eventually found a much-needed equaliser.&nbsp; Skipper Thabo Nthethe levelled matters with a glancing header following a brilliant free kick by Billiat in the 57 minute.&nbsp; Man of the Match Manyama ultimately grabbed his brace with eight minutes of regular time left after a beautiful display of football from Ngoma, who dribbled past Downs&rsquo; defenders to lay it out for his teammate.&nbsp; Mosimane will be hoping things go better when they travel to Limpopo to play Polokwane City in a league match at New Peter Mokaba Stadium on Wednesday&nbsp;
