CHOOSING the perfect hairstyle can be tricky. Not only should it look good, it should also complement your facial features.So, before you book your next salon appointment, make sure you know what face shape you have and which styles will suit it best.Oval :People with oval face shapes are lucky because they can have almost any hairstyle they want, whether it&rsquo;s long or short.This face shape doesn&rsquo;t have a limited selection of hairstyles that suits it.The aim is not to go for hairstyles that will make your face appear longer or wider. If you get a fringe, make sure it stops at the outside corner of your eyebrows so your face doesn&rsquo;t look squared off.Other hairstyles that suit oval faces include a pixie haircut, long wavy hair, short curls, a bob and a ponytail. Almost everything!Hairstyles to avoid:Try to avoid hairstyles that cover your eyes or hang in your face.Round:This is another face shape that isn&rsquo;t too difficult to style. If you&rsquo;re going for a fringe it should be a side fringe, so your face doesn&rsquo;t appear smaller and rounder. Middle partings also do well for round faces as they give the illusion of a narrower face shape. Top knots also work well with round faces as they draw attention to the top part of the head instead of the face. Hairstyles to avoid:Chin-length bob cuts can work against you, as they create a wider, shorter shape.Square:If you have a square face like Angelina Jolie then say yes to long hair and add side bangs to break up the cut in a flattering way. This will give you the illusion of a round face. Other good hair looks are a half-up top knot or long waves.Hairstyles to avoid:Chin-length bob cuts with heavy bangs and centre partings Heart:Any chin-length hairstyle works. And long hair parted in the centre looks good on a heart-shaped face. The lines make your face appear longer. Hairstyles to avoid:Short styles can highlight the upper part of your face, and they create an upside triangular shape.
