NEWLY appointed Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane has promised to provide her staff with fair and good service.Mkhwebane said this during her first media briefing, which was held yesterday at her office in Tshwane. She said since taking over from Thuli Madonsela she had noticed that the staff were in low spirits. She said since she had come into office she had been flooded by requests from the media, wanting to know what her first week in the post had been like.She said: &ldquo;I am not in competition with anybody.&ldquo;I will abide by the law and will exercise my powers and functions without any fear, favour or prejudice.&rdquo;Mkhwebane said she had met with the unit&rsquo;s senior management and now had a sense of how things were done. &ldquo;I recognise that an organisation&rsquo;s workers are its greatest asset. I will listen to my staff in order to address the issues affecting this office.&rdquo;&ldquo;The root cause of all our problems is the fact that the office does not have enough resources.&ldquo;I have already brought this issue to Parliament&rsquo;s attention,&rdquo; Mkhwebane said.She said &ndash; after looking at the annual report prepared by the previous public protector &ndash; that she was uncomfortable with donor funding and with using consultants for investigative work.She said she would do away with these practices.When she was asked about her predecessor&rsquo;s report on state capture, she said: &ldquo;Only the court will decide if the report should be released or not. &ldquo;I have met with attorneys and they have not given me a way forward. I cannot say much about the matter.&rdquo;
