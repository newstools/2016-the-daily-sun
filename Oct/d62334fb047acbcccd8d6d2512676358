WHAT seemed like a lazy Sunday afternoon in Wattville, Ekurhuleni turned into a scene of drama. A woman crashed into a stationary car and tried to speed off. But the owner of the car she had crashed into gave chase. Then the woman ploughed into two kids playing in a park near Oliver Tambo Museum. A third kid managed to avoid being injured. The children are aged between six and eight.Residents gathered around her and tried to beat her up.A resident said: &ldquo;Her car knocked over our children, but she still had the nerve to talk nonsense instead of apologising!&ldquo;She was arrogant and didn&rsquo;t realise how serious the matter was. She asked us why we don&rsquo;t look after our kids.&rdquo;The residents claimed the driver bragged about her mum being a police captain and claimed she&rsquo;d be let off.&ldquo;She&rsquo;s lucky cops were around, otherwise she would have swallowed her words,&rdquo; said another resident.Residents had to rescue a six-year-old boy who was trapped under the woman&rsquo;s car. He and the other victim were rushed to hospital. The boys are fighting for their lives.Phumzile Tshwaedi said her son and his two cousins were coming back from church and stopped to play in the park.She said: &ldquo;My son narrowly escaped death. &ldquo;He saw the car coming towards him and managed to run away.&rdquo; The driver was taken to Actonville Police Station, where a case of reckless driving and two cases of attempted murder were opened.
