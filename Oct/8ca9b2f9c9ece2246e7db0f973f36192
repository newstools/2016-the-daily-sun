GAUTENG&rsquo;S education department is under pressure to make sure the province has the highest matric pass rate in the country.Last year it was toppled by Western Cape, which achieved an 84,7% pass rate, while Gauteng was hot on its heels with 84,2%. Yesterday, education MEC Panyaza Lesufi encouraged students to roll up their sleeves and get to work. &ldquo;The department has done everything possible to provide the best possible chance for each pupil to do well in these exams. We want to assure the people of Gauteng we&rsquo;re ready as a province,&rdquo; he said. The matric exams start today with the computer applications technology practical exam and end on 29 November with the design exam. Most pupils will start next Wednesday when they write English. KZN has registered the highest number of candidates with 169 661, followed by Gauteng with 153 973 and Limpopo with 110 565.
