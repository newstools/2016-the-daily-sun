MINISTER of Mineral Resources Mosebenzi Zwane today joined the growing list of politicians trying to stop the release of the state capture report. The report was drafted by former public protector Thuli Madonsela, who had planned to release it on her last day in office. Madonsela was stopped in her tracks by President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s court action. The president complained he had not been given enough time to respond to her questions.Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des Van Rooyen joined the court bid, also complaining he had not been given enough time to respond. He later withdrew his application after reportedly learning he had not been implicated in the report. However, over the weekend he launched another application. Zuma&rsquo;s application will be heard in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria tomorrow, with various political parties opposing it. Opposition parties have called for the report to be released without delay. Zwane said he was launching an urgent application to stop the release or publication of the report and its findings and recommendations. &ldquo;The minister had no option but to be involved in this matter as he was not afforded an opportunity to answer allegations levelled against him,&rdquo; his office said in a statement. It has been suggested Zwane was implicated in a letter the public protector handed to him. &ldquo;The public protector cannot confirm or deny whether the report, which is now alleged to be in its final form, makes any findings against the minister,&rdquo; the statement from Zwane&rsquo;s office read.
