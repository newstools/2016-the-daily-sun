LIBERIA has a new hero in Anthony Laffor! The country has always celebrated George Weah, the only African player to have been crowned Fifa&rsquo;s World Footballer of the Year. But now they can also celebrate Laffor &ndash; the first Liberian to win a Caf Champions League gold medal.Laffor&rsquo;s phone did not stop ringing on Sunday night following Mamelodi Sundowns&rsquo; victory in the Champions League here.He revealed that people back in Liberia were celebrating the victory too, for one of their own now also had a gold winners&rsquo; medal.&ldquo;I am speechless. This is record-breaking for me. Thanks to my teammates and everyone who contributed to this success. It was not easy out there but we had to do it for our families and supporters. It&rsquo;s great to put Liberia on the map again,&rdquo; said Laffor. He said their road to success was littered with obstacles, which they managed to overcome. &ldquo;The good thing is that we did the job at home. They tried to intimidate us but it didn&rsquo;t work, as we came prepared. &ldquo;I remember when we went to Congo and had no network for five days. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve reaped what we&rsquo;ve sown considering where we&rsquo;ve come from and what we went through. People didn&rsquo;t believe in us but coach Pitso Mosimane kept us going.&rdquo;Laffor said he used not to take the Champions League seriously but his attitude changed after Mosimane arrived at Sundowns.&ldquo;The only thing I thought of before was just taking part. I was at SuperSport and we were only involved for two or three games &ndash; but Pitso pushed us and I am happy we have been rewarded.&rdquo;He said they would need to keep their feet on the ground as the domestic season had just started for them.&ldquo;The sooner we forget about this game the better for us. We are the champions and we have our medals and the star, but we need to move on. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to blame ourselves if we don&rsquo;t do well in upcoming games.&rdquo;
