SOUTH African boxing&rsquo;s golden boy, Kevin &ldquo;The KO Kid&rdquo; Lerena, has given Danish prospect Micki &ldquo;One Punch&rdquo; Nielsen his first taste of defeat to win the Super Four cruiserweight final at Emperors Palace on Saturday.The 24-year-old warrior registered a victory by majority on points over the highly rated Nielsen in a fight that seemed more like a wrestling match than a boxing contest. Both boxers were holding and wrestling each other, which saw veteran referee Stan Christodoulou having a busy night in separating them throughout the 10 rounds.Lerena says everything went according to plan: &ldquo;We knew Nielsen is talented and a hard puncher. &ldquo;The plan was to not allow him to get busy. I did exactly that and it worked.&rdquo;The confident Lerena feels certain he could beat any challenger out there. Two judges scored in favour of the South African, with the scorecard of Jean-Robert Laine (France) reading 96-95 and Berit Andereasen (Denmark) scoring it 97-93, while South African judge Jaap van Niewenhuizen scored the contest a draw (95-95).Lerana&rsquo;s record improves to 17 wins and one defeat, while Nielsen who is ranked No 10 by the International Boxing Organisation, No 5 by the World Boxing Organisation, No 10 by the World Boxing Council and a lofty No 4 by the International Boxing Federation, drops to 22 wins and one defeat. The talented fighter will get 60% of the R1,4 million in prize money. - In the main supporting bout former South African welterweight champion Chris &ldquo;The Heat&rdquo; van Heerden celebrated his SA homecoming with a victory over tough Namibian Sacky Shikukutu to capture the WBA Pan African welterweight crown.
