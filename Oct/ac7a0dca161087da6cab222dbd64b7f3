THE Independent Civic Movement of South Africa has sprung into action to defend Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Athol Trollip!Last week in KwaNobuhle the mayor was allegedly booed and verbally attacked during the municipality&rsquo;s integrated development plan meeting. He allegedly received the same treatment in Kuyga in Greenbushes. On Tuesday night the interim chairman of the civic movement Newman Simakuhle addressed hundreds of residents who packed the Babs Madlakane Hall in KwaNobuhle, Uitenhage.Simakuhle urged the emotional residents to defend their rights by allowing Trollip back to the hall where he was chased out.Simakuhle said: &ldquo;Our town was number one in the struggle and now we are number zero in development.&rdquo;He said dozens of disgruntled ANC leaders were buying residents booze to disrupt Trollip at the meetings.Madala Zolile Mama (72) said: &ldquo;The youths who verbally abused him come from families that have a trillion in the bank. &ldquo;Councillors get their salaries every month on the 25th yet deprive residents of service delivery. I was there when a disappointed Trollip walked out and said bye-bye to us.&rdquo;ANC national spokesman Zizi Kodwa said since taking over as mayor, Trollip has failed to deliver services. He claimed Trollop used the ANC as a scapegoat.
