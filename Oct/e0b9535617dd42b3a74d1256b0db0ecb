POLICE in Pretoria pounced on #FeesMustFall demonstrator and Economic Freedom Fighters student command national member Naledi Chirwa in the early hours of Wednesday morning for being in contempt of a court order. Chirwa is also one of four young women who staged a Remember Khwezi demonstration during an address by President Jacob Zuma at the Independent Electoral Commission&rsquo;s results centre. &ldquo;They arrested her in a disgusting and disturbing manner,&rdquo; her lawyer, Meshack Thipe, told News24 just minutes after Chirwa&rsquo;s court appearance. Thipe said an officer arrived to arrest the 23-year-old student at her home in Mamelodi at around 4am, taking her to Brooklyn police station without informing her of the charges she faced. Chirwa appeared before the Pretoria Magistrates Court, where she was granted bail of R1 000 and told to appear again on 11 January 2017. Thipe said his client spent most of the morning feeling confused, learning of the charge that she faced only during the court proceedings. He said she faced a charge of being in contempt of a court order. This was in relation to an interdict obtained against demonstrations on the University of Pretoria campus. Students have been protesting since September, demanding the immediate implementation of free education. &ldquo;She was absolutely disturbed. I do not understand why they could not have waited for morning, or at least last night? Why in the early hours?&rdquo; asked Thipe. EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi slated the arrest, tweeting that Chirwa had been taken from her bed, where she was asleep next to her infant child.&nbsp; He said this was done to terrify her so that she would not question authority. Ndlozi decried the arrest of 600 other students who had been protesting. &ndash;&thinsp;NEWS24
