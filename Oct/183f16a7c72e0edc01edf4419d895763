Those who received an invitation to the party were honoured because her life has been such an inspiration. Her first-born daughter, Rachel Phashane (75), became very emotional when she talked about her mother. &ldquo;It was tough for my mother and for us as well because at first when we came to this village in 1955, people here were not so welcoming,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But my mother stood on her feet and proved to everyone how strong she is. &ldquo;She worked at the farms, ensuring that at the end of the day we had something to eat. She took us to school. &ldquo;Today here we are, and we have improved her life.&rdquo; Gogo Mohlatlego said she was just amazed by the love her children showed her.She added that she wishes them to prosper more in their lives.
