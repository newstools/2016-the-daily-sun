You're driving along and a snake suddenly jumps through your window and lands on your dashboard. What do you do? That was the dilemma facing a Zimbabwean driver in the eastern city of Mutare last week and he did not think twice: he jumped out of his moving vehicle, according to the Manica Post newspaper. Julius Hozheri's driverless delivery van rammed into a shopping centre in central Mutare, the paper says in its latest edition. Fortunately no-one was hurt but part of a financial institution was damaged. Hozheri himself escaped unscathed - most likely because his van was slowing down to reach a junction. The Manica Post said he had trouble convincing passersby that a snake had "jumped" into his car - until they saw it with their own eyes in the (now battered) delivery van.Dangerous snakes&nbsp;Police and bystanders confirmed the incident.Hozheri told the paper the snake was getting ready to strike him, adding: "Some said I was hallucinating while others said I was trying to cover up negligent driving by attributing the accident to wild assertions.""People started to believe me when they found the snake in the damaged car.""What I knew was that I was alive and had escaped from the jaws of death."The paper said the snake might be an Eastern brown snake but that seems unlikely since Zimbabwe is not a known habitat of this snake. There are a number of highly dangerous snakes found in this part of Zimbabwe, including black mambas, spitting cobras and gaboon vipers. There are also a number of harmless snakes in the area.Last year a black mamba interfered with Mutare's water supply by chasing away electricians and technicians trying to work on a water tank there, the Manica Post reported.http://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/snake-jumps-into-moving-zimbabwe-van-so-driver-jumps-out-2016101
