IF IT was not for his 4-5, Cosy Ngcebetsha (35) could have been married to an old man today. A 71-year-old madala from Mthata, Eastern Cape decided he wanted to marry a younger woman, and when his family objected, he decided to go ahead anyway. A 23-year-old magosha agreed and a forced marriage, known as ukuthwala, was arranged. The plan was for the girl to wait under a tree on Sunday night for the madala&rsquo;s friends to pick her up, but the magosha was late. That&rsquo;s when Cosy Ngcebetsha from Khwenxurha Village arrived. Cosy was mistaken for the woman because he was wearing a red dress. &ldquo;I was walking home from my boyfriend&rsquo;s house when a group of men grabbed me and carried me away,&rdquo; said Cosy. He said he was taken to a house and forcefully dressed up like a makoti. Cosy was then introduced to the madala as her new husband. &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t believe I was a man. I was forced to reveal my 4-5. The madala grabbed a panga and threatened to cut off my 4-5.&rdquo; Fortunately, the magosha girlfriend arrived. Cosy said the madala and his family apologised to him and offered him five sheep. He didn&rsquo;t open a case because of the peace offering and the madala also offered to pay for trauma counselling. The madala admitted his mistake, but said there is nothing wrong with ukuthwala. &ldquo;Ukuthwala is customary law and not illegal in South Africa.&rdquo;
