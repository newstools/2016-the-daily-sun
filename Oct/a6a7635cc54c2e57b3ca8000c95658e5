MPUMALANGA community safety, security and liaison MEC Petrus Ngomane has visited a devastated family from Mashushu near Hazyview which lost five members in a road crash last Saturday.Children and adults from the Mona family were travelling from Tshwane to Nelspruit when the bakkie they were travelling in went out of control and overturned on the N4 between Bronkhorspruit and Pretoria at about 9am. Three kids died at the scene while another two died in hospital. Five other occupants, including the driver, were admitted to Steve Biko Hospital with serious injuries. A case of culpable homicide is being investigated, said department spokesman Joseph Mabuza.During his visit on Monday, Ngomane called on motorists to be cautious on the road and to always rest when undertaking long-distance trips. Fatigue is one of the factors contributing to road crashes, the MEC said. Therefore it is important for motorists to always consider resting every 200km or every two hours to save the lives of innocent people. AENS
