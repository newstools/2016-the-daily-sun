ON MONDAY morning, Sheila opened the tap in her kitchen . . . and sewage water came pouring out.&ldquo;I tried to boil the water, but my kettle was filled with dirty foam,&rdquo; said Sheila Mawela from Temba, in Hammanskraal, Tshwane. It seems the residents of Hammanskraal have sewage water in their taps because of cable theft at the Rooiwal waste water treatment plant.The affected areas are Stinkwater, Dilopye, New Eersterust, Temba, Babelegi Industries, Marokolong, Ramotse, Majaneng, Mandela Village, Sekampaneng and Hammanskraal.The theft of the cable has affected the process to clean the water and now dirty water runs straight into the residents&rsquo; taps.Lindela Mashigo, spokesman for the City of Tshwane, said: &ldquo;The water and sanitation department was forced to do an emergency shutdown of the plant. This is because of the water contamination from a raw polluted water source. It was caused by cable theft at the plant.&rdquo;He said the plant will remain closed until further notice. &ldquo;The city is working hard to ensure the plant becomes operational as soon as possible.&rdquo; Councillor Aaron Maluleka said residents will get water from communal tanks. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d like to assure residents that the water from the tanks is not dirty. It&rsquo;s collected from Soshanguve and will be delivered until the situation is under control.&ldquo;It is going to take two weeks to clean and stabilise the Apies River and Rooiwal plant. &ldquo;This is going to affect the businesses in the area badly. Many stores will be closed today and Babelegi Industrial Site also had to close.&rdquo;
