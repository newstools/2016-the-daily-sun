THE ancestral bank in his house has been reduced to ashes.On Monday, Vusi Phakhadi put R6 500, half of his salary, in a secret corner where he burns impepho. He does this every month to ask his ancestors to bless his money before spending it the next day.Unfortunately, the money was burned when his shack in Bekkersdal, west of Joburg caught fire that night.Vusi said: &ldquo;On the 24th of every month, I ask my ancestors to guard my money. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my way of thanking them for my job.&ldquo;I have been doing this for five years.&ldquo;On Saturday, I slaughtered a chicken and ate it. &ldquo;But it had a bad taste. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when I knew something bad would happen soon.&ldquo;Then everything in my shack was burned. &ldquo;Even my kids&rsquo; school uniforms were destroyed by the flames. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really painful to lose everything you own. Where am I going to sleep now?&rdquo;Vusi&rsquo;s neighbour, Sonnyboy Moreki, said: &ldquo;The fire was so big. &ldquo;One of the firemen even prayed before he started putting out the fire. &ldquo;Fortunately, it did not destroy any other shacks.&rdquo;To make matters worse, Vusi said his car was stolen on the same day his shack caught fire.Bekkersdal police spokeswoman Sergeant Linki Lefakane said: &ldquo;There is no case recorded and opened in our system.&ldquo;I advise him to open a case at the local police station.&rdquo;
