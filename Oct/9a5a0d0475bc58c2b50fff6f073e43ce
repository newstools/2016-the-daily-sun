THE girl thought sex would get her a laptop.But she&rsquo;s still offline, and said:&nbsp;&ldquo;THE BLESSER BONKED ME MAHALA!&rdquo;These bitter words came from Masego Tselapedi&thinsp;(20) from Rustenburg in North West. She claims blesser Serge Cabonge used her body, but gave her little in return.Masego is a second-year student at Tshwane University of Technology in Pretoria. She claimed she had sex with Serge three weeks ago &ndash; because she wanted him to buy her a laptop. The part-time model and dancer told Sunday Sun: &ldquo;I met Serge through a friend. We began chatting via WhatsApp and he came over to our place to see me.&nbsp;&ldquo;He took me to lunch at the Southern Sun in Sandton. I had a hot chocolate.&rdquo;Masego went on to claim: &ldquo;After lunch, Serge took me to Taboo Night Club &ndash; where he bought me a bottle of Hennessy and an Appletiser. &ldquo;I was with three girls the whole night. I drank the whole bottle alone as he was sitting with friends.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who those women were, but I think they were also blessees.&rdquo;She further claimed she stayed at Taboo until 3am, and was taken by a friend of Serge&rsquo;s to an apartment. &ldquo;Serge came to my room at 5am and we had sex. We used a condom &ndash; but it burst!&ldquo;When I asked him if he&rsquo;d ejaculated inside me, he said the condom didn&rsquo;t break. We did one round and he left.&ldquo;I stayed there in that flat with no food for the whole day. He came back at 3pm. He took me to McDonald&rsquo;s and bought me a burger,&rdquo; she said. Masego claimed Serge sent her to withdraw R6&thinsp;000, gave her R1&thinsp;000, then dropped her at the Sandton Gautrain station.&ldquo;When I arrived in Pretoria I rushed to a doctor for a check-up, because the condom broke. I used R500 for the consultation fee, R200 for pills and R200 for HIV testing. &ldquo;I used R60 to board the train from Sandton to Pretoria. So I was left with nothing!&ldquo;My reason to flirt with Serge was because I wanted him to buy me a laptop, as mine got stolen in April. I regret doing what I did. I know it&rsquo;s wrong, but I wanted to experiment with the blesser thing,&rdquo; she said.The sadder and wiser girl told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;I want to warn young people against blessers. They don&rsquo;t bless people. They&rsquo;re only after sex. &ldquo;I feel Serge f*ck*d me for mahala &ndash; and he never answered my plea for him to buy me a laptop!&rdquo;Yesterday Serge said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;He added: &ldquo;That woman only came to me and said I must buy her a laptop. I don&rsquo;t know her. I never slept with her. I&rsquo;ll find her and confront her.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
