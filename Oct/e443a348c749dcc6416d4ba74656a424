ABRAM Moale (31) decided to help a nyaope addict turn his life around, but his good deed backfired!This is after the nyaope addict became too big for his own boots and started demanding more money from him.And when Abram refused, the addict burnt the workshop to the ground.Abram of Mabopane, north of Tshwane said he regretted ever helping the addict.&ldquo;He was one of my regular customers who sold scrap metal. I felt sorry for him because he would sometimes come bruised and injured after the community had beat him up for stealing.&ldquo;I decided to teach him how to fix electricity appliances and gave him 20% of the profit. &ldquo;It broke my heart to find out that he had been using the money to buy drugs. I had hoped that he would turn his life around, but the money made him worse,&rdquo; he said.Abram said the nyaope addict started demanding that they share the profit equally even though he was using his resources.&ldquo;He became arrogant and greedy. He would come with his friends with stolen goods and try to sell them to me. I refused because I did not want to get into trouble with the law,&rdquo; he said.Abram said he was not shocked when he was told that his workshop was on fire. &ldquo;He told me last Wednesday that his friends were planning to burn down my workshop because I didn&rsquo;t want to support them. Loate police spokesman Captain Samuel Sebola said a case of arson was opened. &ldquo;No arrest has yet been made,&rdquo; he said.
