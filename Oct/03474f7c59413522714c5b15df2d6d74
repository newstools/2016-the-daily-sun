DBN NYTS group member Cebo Ngcobo is allegedly playing hide and seek with Lerato Mogoswane .Early this year, the SunTeam reported that Cebo had allegedly impregnated the 21-year-old student and refused to acknowledge her as his baby mama.Now Lerato claims Cebo is nowhere to be found &ndash; since the birth of her child.She said Cebo asked for a DNA test to determine whether he was the dad &ndash; then vanished into thin air.Speaking to Sunday Sun, Lerato said she&rsquo;s considering consulting lawyers.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s making a fool of me. It&rsquo;s like I made the kid by myself. He doesn&rsquo;t want to take ownership of the fact that he&rsquo;s our child&rsquo;s dad. And I&rsquo;m not forcing him to be in a relationship with me, but he should be a father to his child,&rdquo; she claimed. She added: &ldquo;I asked his manager, Scotch, to give me his new home address &ndash; so I can tell him I&rsquo;m ready to do a DNA test. But Scotch refused.&rdquo;Scotch said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not allowed to give out artists&rsquo; addresses, but she did call requesting it.&rdquo;Cebo said: &ldquo;This girl was sleeping around, isifebe. Her friends told me she&rsquo;s messing with me and people from Kalawa told me I should stay away from her. I told her I&rsquo;d do the DNA test when I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;
