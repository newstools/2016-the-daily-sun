THESE residents are being terrorised by crocodiles that kill their goats. Since the beginning of the year, 15 goats belonging to Hasani Maluleke from Makuleke Village, outside Malamulele in Limpopo, have been devoured by the frightening reptiles. Hasani told Daily Sun five of the goats were killed this week. He said the goats were attacked when they went to Makuleke Dam to drink water. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of these greedy crocodiles eating my goats without permission,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They must leave my goats to drink the water when they are thirsty. &ldquo;The crocodiles must not act like they own the dam. &ldquo;It belongs to the community.&rdquo; Hasani said when the problem first started, he thought livestock thieves were taking his goats.&ldquo;I found out what was happening when a local fisherman alerted me to what was really going on.&rdquo; Hasani said he was unemployed and survived by selling his goats to members of the community. Eric Tivani of the local tribal authority said: &ldquo;Almost every day, we receive reports of goats getting killed by crocodiles at the local dam. Unfortunately there&rsquo;s nothing we can do about the situation. &ldquo;The only advice we can give to those with livestock is to monitor their animals when they go to the dam to drink. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only way they can protect them from the crocodiles.&rdquo; He said in the past, a number of people were also killed by crocodiles when they went to fetch water, fish or wash clothes.
