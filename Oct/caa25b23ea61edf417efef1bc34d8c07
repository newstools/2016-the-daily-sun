JOHN Thobela has not only lost his wife to another man, but his hard-earned R20 000 was used to build the new couple&rsquo;s love nest.And what hurts John more is that the man who stole his wife of eight years is his long-time employee. He has allegedly been getting quickies from John&rsquo;s wife each time he was sent to run errands.John (33), a panel beater from Joe Slovo near Komatipoort in Mpumalanga, said he only discovered that his employee, Alfred Khoza (25), had been bonking his wife three months when he caught them in bed together at his house. John said his wife packed her bags and moved out, taking their three kids and his bank card with R20 000 in it. A few days later she allegedly returned while John was at work, and took all the furniture.&ldquo;I did not want to disturb their happiness, all I asked for was my bank card,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But she would not return it. She said she would use my money to build a room for her and Alfred.&rdquo; John&rsquo;s wife, Helen Maluleka (25) said she had loved John since 2008, but now all the love had gone.&ldquo;My love for him is dead and that is not a sin. &ldquo;I used the R20 000 to build a one-roomed house for our children, not for Alfred.&rdquo;Alfred said John must accept that he was dumped.
