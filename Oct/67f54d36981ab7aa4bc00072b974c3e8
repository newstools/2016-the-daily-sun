Roger de Sa has finally bowed to pressure as he resigned as the head coach of Ajax Cape Town today. This follows a stream of poor results since the start of the season.&nbsp; Their 2-1 defeat to Bidvest Wits at Cape Town Stadium yesterday was the last straw for the former Orlando Pirates coach. De Sa's charges have collected a mere two points in six games so far and are placed 15th position in the Absa Premiership table. Speaking on the Ajax website the mentor said: &ldquo;I would like to thank the management, technical team and the players for all their support during my two and a half years at the club,&rdquo; De Sa explained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve enjoyed every minute of my job especially working with such a youthful squad. I personally think we are on the verge of winning ways but the results have not gone our way. I&rsquo;d like to wish everyone, especially the fantastic supporters, all the success that this club deserves.&rdquo; CEO Ari Efstathiou said: &ldquo;We are thankful to Roger for his contribution to the club and for the success he has brought to the club during his time here. &ldquo;He has been instrumental in implementing many new ideas while part of the Ajax Cape Town technical staff. Moreover, Roger successfully took us to two cup finals with the highlight being the MTN8 triumph last season winning it with a record 10 academy players in the starting line-up.&rdquo; The Urban Warriors management have yet to decide who will be in charge when they host SuperSport United in their next league match at the same venue on Saturday
