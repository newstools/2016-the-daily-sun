SHE used to turn the heads of many men as she walked past. But now her beauty no longer works for her. And it&rsquo;s all because of her jealous, dead baby daddy!Noxolo Sangweni (32) from Dannhauser in northern KZN said the dead man visits her at night and pokes her.&ldquo;My child&rsquo;s father was very jealous. He would accuse me of cheating. I believe his jealousy followed him to the grave. He still does not want any other man to have my punani.&rdquo; Noxolo said ever since her boyfriend died in 2012 due to blood cancer, men had started ignoring her.&ldquo;As a woman I have needs. I&rsquo;m no yellow bone but I know I&rsquo;m beautiful. Before my man died I had men&rsquo;s attention. They would tell me how beautiful I was. I was the talk of the area.&ldquo;But that ended immediately after my boyfriend died. It is now like I have a bad smell,&rdquo; she said.She said she has spent R25 000 going to different sangomas and traditional healers, but nothing has changed.&ldquo;Most of the sangomas told me that I have isinyama (bad luck) and gave me muthi to cleanse myself, but it doesn&rsquo;t go away. I need help,&rdquo; said Noxolo.The dead man&rsquo;s relative who asked not to be named said: &ldquo;We performed a cleansing ceremony to prevent things like this. We can now only help with money for a sangoma to get rid of our cousin&rsquo;s spirit.&rdquo; Her sister, Phindile Sangweni (29) said: &ldquo;Noxolo is always stressed. She is no longer fun to be around.&rdquo;South African Traditional Healers&rsquo; Association president Sazi Mhlongo said that Noxolo was being haunted by a ghost. &ldquo;She needs an inyanga who can chase the ghost away and cleanse her with a goat,&rdquo; said Mhlongo.
