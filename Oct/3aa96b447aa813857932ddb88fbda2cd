HOME Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba launched a new contact centre at the department&rsquo;s head office in Tshwane yesterday. He said the centre was created to make it easier for clients to make enquiries. &ldquo;Our clients can call, send an e-mail or make inquiries through our website if they need assistance from the department.&rdquo; Gigaba said the facility had been operating for a few months and he was happy with its performance. He said 112 young people had been hired and they hoped to hire more in the future. According to the minister, each operator received 120 calls a day and they were able to help callers instantly.&ldquo;At our previous call centre people couldn&rsquo;t get the help they needed because operators didn&rsquo;t have the necessary equipment. &ldquo;Now they can trace the progress of a query without any hassles.&ldquo;Our operators can now help our clients instantly because all their information comes up on our database.&rdquo; Gigaba said the centre operated from 7.30am to 5.30pm during the week and between 8am and 12pm on Saturdays. He said asylum seekers could also phone if they wanted to enquire about documents. The service number is 08600 60 11 90. He said those who wanted to apply for a job at the centre should have a matric certificate and a minimum of three years of call centre experience. &ldquo;The department gives one month of training before hiring operators.&rdquo;
