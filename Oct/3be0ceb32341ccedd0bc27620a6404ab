JUST a year ago, Yuri Magagula was not only complimented on his good looks and charm, but also on his brains.Now he is called names, the most offensive being &ldquo;chicken skin&rdquo;, &ldquo;rubbish bin&rdquo; and &ldquo;son of a crocodile&rdquo;.The bullying forced him to drop out of school. Yuri (9), of Phakama near Komatipoort in Mpumalanga, began suffering from a skin condition that is now making his life a living hell. He began developing sores all over his body, which are accompanied by a foul stench that has not only made him an outcast, but also a target for bullies at school.His mother, Sarifa Magagula (28) said her son used to be handsome and a top pupil at school. But then the sores struck in March. &ldquo;The kids at school don&rsquo;t want to play with him anymore because of the sores and the smell.&rdquo; &ldquo;His schoolwork also suffered.&rdquo;Yuri said he couldn&rsquo;t concentrate in class, and his June results dropped. &ldquo;I want to go back to school because if I don&rsquo;t, I won&rsquo;t become a pilot. &ldquo;I need a doctor to heal me soon so I can go back to class.&rdquo; Sarifa said she has taken Yuri to clinics and hospitals and has bought a wide variety of ointments, but nothing has helped.&ldquo;All I am told is that my son has eczema.&rdquo;Dumisani Malamule from the department of health said they have contacted Yuri&rsquo;s mum to get the details of his condition.An appointment has been set up for him to see a doctor.
