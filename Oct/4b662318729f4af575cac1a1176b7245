IF AMAZULU head coach Joey Antipas&rsquo; words are anything to go by, all is not well in the Usuthu camp. In an interview with SunSport, the Zimbabwean revealed that &ldquo;disturbing elements&rdquo; had led to the club&rsquo;s biggest defeat in the National First Division (NFD) this season, the 4-1 loss to Jomo Cosmos at Olen Park on Sunday. Whether those elements came from the management&rsquo;s side or from his players, Antipas was unwilling to say. Reluctant to elaborate too much, he said: &ldquo;Some things are hard to disclose to the media. But before the match against Jomo Cosmos there were some elements that really disturbed the team and that was the main reason we lost the match. I hope all will be resolved before we play our next match this weekend.&rdquo; AmaZulu are already six points behind NFD log leaders Thanda Royal Zulu after losing two games in a row. Antipas understands that the pressure is on now and said he needed to do something fast to change the situation. Usuthu&rsquo;s next match will be played in front of their unhappy fans when they face Stellenbosch FC at Princess Magogo Stadium in KwaMashu on Sunday (3.30pm). Antipas has already experienced how AmaZulu fans behave when they are not happy. Players came under threat when they lost their first and only match at home to FC Cape Town three weeks ago. Seeing that it was the first loss of the season for Usuthu, fans were not pleased at all. Going back there after losing to Cosmos will surely put Antipas and his charges under massive pressure as they will be expected to deliver three points &ndash; and the coach knows that. &ldquo;The last two matches were nothing but a minor setback. We will bounce back. We need get our act together and display the standard of football we are known for,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We need to beat Stellenbosch at all costs. We can&rsquo;t afford to be far off the log leaders.&rdquo;
