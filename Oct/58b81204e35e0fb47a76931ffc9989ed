&ldquo;I ESCAPED death by virtue of luck!&rdquo; These are the words of devastated Dumisani Mthembu (47) from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, whose home was burnt to the ground. Dumisani told the SunTeam he was asleep last Monday night, when he suddenly struggled to breathe.&ldquo;When I opened my eyes, there was smoke everywhere. My bedroom roof was on fire. I rushed to the door and realised my mum&rsquo;s house was on fire.&rdquo; He added what surprised him was no one had bothered to wake him up.&ldquo;I live with tenants in the yard but when they realised the house was burning, they moved their belongings out of their rooms and just stood outside and watched as the rest of the house caught fire.&rdquo; Dumisani suspected his niece set the house alight to kill him. &ldquo;She wanted to burn me while I was sleeping. &ldquo;She has been fighting with me over this house saying it&rsquo;s her gogo&rsquo;s house. But my mum is still alive. She&rsquo;s fighting for inheritance while the owner is still alive.&ldquo;I never had a problem staying with her before but she was misbehaving and bringing different men who come and cause chaos.&rdquo;Dumisani claims he now lives in fear and can hardly sleep at night. He fears his niece will come back and finish what she started.When Daily Sun contacted Dumisani&rsquo;s niece, Biki Sithole (31), she claimed she had nothing to gain by burning the house. &ldquo;I lived with my gogo all along till my uncle&rsquo;s return from KZN in July.&ldquo;When he came, he just wanted to control everything and asked me to move out. He even choked me,&rdquo; she said.Biki claims she moved out in August. &ldquo;I want nothing to do with my uncle and I am not fighting with him. &ldquo;He is fighting alone! &ldquo;Why would I fight him for his mum&rsquo;s house? I only went to the house on Monday to fetch the rest of my belongings.&rdquo; Captain Lesetja Mathobela said police are investigating a case of arson. No one has been arrested yet.
