THIS family says number 4 is a sign of bad luck for them.In 1994, Rebecca Mokoena&rsquo;s only son Oupa disappeared without trace.Ten years later (2004) her husband Ishmael also vanished.The family visited a sangoma who told that they have been cursed with idukanezwe muthi.The sangoma told them the intention is to make all male members of the family disappear without trace.Now they are wondering who&rsquo;s next.&ldquo;In 2014 we were scared and guarding our three young like a hawk. We don&rsquo;t trust anything because we don&rsquo;t know who did this to our family,&rdquo; said Ouma Mokoena (38).&ldquo;We lock the gates to stop the boys from wandering away especially on weekends. We check them when they are playing outside.&rdquo;Rebecca (42) said a sangoma came to strengthen her home so none of her male grandchildren disappeared.But even though the sangoma performed rituals she still lives in fear.What worries her most is that her husband and son were mentally well when they disappeared.&ldquo;I would understand if they were mentally disturbed or if we quarrelled, but none of that is a factor.&rdquo;Rebecca said she doesn&rsquo;t sleep at night when she thinks about their disappearances.&ldquo;I sometimes see my husband in dreams and he doesn&rsquo;t seem to be happy.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking for prayers.&rdquo; Sangoma Madoda Vhuthela says idukanezwe is used by some zangoma to destabilise families. &ldquo;The muthi makes members of the family disappear without any reason.&rdquo;
