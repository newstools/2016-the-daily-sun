SELF-PROCLAIMED international blesser and prominent businessman, Serge Cabonge, has hit back at Masego Tselapedi, the girl who claimed he bonked and promised to buy a laptop, but didn&rsquo;t.This week, in a dramatic turn of events, Masego (20), changed her tune and claimed she doesn&rsquo;t know Serge and never did an interview with Sunday Sun.But Serge is having none of it.Speaking to the People&rsquo;s Paper, the blesser said: &ldquo;I have WhatsApp messages from this girl asking me for a laptop. I was only introduced to her by my cousin and never slept with her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a responsible man. Her claims that I slept with her and did not use a condom are all lies. She will suffer the consequences.&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m a blesser and an international one for that matter, but I&rsquo;m aware there will be people who want to take advantage and spread all sorts of lies about me. &ldquo;I will not buy her a laptop because she lied about me. she&rsquo;s still a student and I&rsquo;ve helped many students in the past.&rdquo;He continued: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m even prepared to take a lie detector test to show the world I never slept with that woman. She&rsquo;s still young and perhaps she&rsquo;s surrounded by wrong people.&rdquo;Masego is a second-year student at the Tshwane University of Technology in Pretoria. She claimed she had sex with Serge three weeks ago &ndash; because she wanted him to buy her a laptop.Yesterday, when asked to comment on the new allegations from Serge, she said: &ldquo;No comment, leave me alone.&rdquo;
