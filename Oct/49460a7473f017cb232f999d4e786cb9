Deputy Defence and Military Veterans Minister Kebby Maphatsoe on Friday refused to comment on a picture allegedly showing him standing naked in what looks like a hotel room.The picture shows a man, with an amputated arm, leaning over a table reading a newspaper.In the forefront of the photo is the naked thigh of a woman who appears to be lying in a bed, and who probably took the photo. It has been circulating on social media."I am not commenting on this issue," Maphatsoe said.He spoke to the media on the side-lines of the first national general council of the South African National Military Veterans Association. He is also the chairperson of the ANC&rsquo;s Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association.Maphatsoe said he was only prepared to comment on the council.He disputed making comments, posted on a Twitter account under his name and with his photo as the profile picture."I don&rsquo;t know how to use Twitter myself. I just hear people call me and say I responded on Twitter. I don't have a Twitter account, you can investigate my phone," Maphatsoe said.Earlier this month, Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande disputed that it was him in a picture in the buff after a steamy session with a student. He said the image was malicious and fake."It is very clear that it is not Minister Blade Nzimande who is in this image," his spokesperson Harold Maloka said."The ministry would like to categorically deny and reject this irresponsible and malicious attempt to link the minister to this image. The minister does not have a relationship with a student as alleged and the image is by no means that of the minister."http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/maphatsoe-wont-say-if-he-is-the-naked-man-in-photo-20161028
