THE devoted church member spent the day decorating an altar for a funeral service to be held on Saturday.But Jeanette Tlhagane from Mohlakeng, Randfontein, west of Joburg, died before she could attend the service.It appears that the 58-year-old said her early morning prayers on Saturday morning. As she is a Roman Catholic, she lit a candle next to her rosaries and the Bible.But then neighbours were woken by flames coming from Jeanette&rsquo;s bedroom. Jeanette died in the fire in her bedroom.&ldquo;My aunt devoted her life to the church,&rdquo; said her niece, Otilia Motene (38).Jeanette&rsquo;s daughter, Nana Marema told Daily Sun her mum woke up at midnight every night to pray with a bright candle, and then prayed later when she woke up.&ldquo;It looks as if she had finished praying and went back to sleep. &ldquo;Perhaps the candle caught the curtain and the smoke made her dizzy,&rdquo; said Nana.She said she will always remember her mother&rsquo;s Bible teachings.Neighbours used water to kill the fire.Firefighters arrived but it was too late for Jeanette.Jeanette&rsquo;s elder sister, Manku Tlhagane-Mokgoka (72), said her sister took religion very seriously.&ldquo;She was a lovely, kind, happy person. We will miss her.&rdquo; Father Nkosinathi Nkabinde added: &ldquo;It was a sad day seeing God&rsquo;s child lying dead. May the spirit of the Lord be with her.&rdquo; Randfontein police spokeswoman Captain Appel Ernst confirmed the incident.&ldquo;We have opened an inquest docket and are still investigating.&rdquo; she said.
