AS THE saying goes, &ldquo;age is nothing but a number.&rdquo; Deliwe Mtheko (60) and Richard Chaoke (50) have been together for six years and they&rsquo;re growing stronger every day.&ldquo;He takes good care of me. I don&rsquo;t work or receive social grants, but I always have food in the house.&rdquo;She said after losing her husband in 2010 she thought she was going to be lonely.&ldquo;God sent me a man and now my life is not the same anymore, it&rsquo;s great.&rdquo; The head-over-heels woman said Richard makes her feel young and sexy.&ldquo;He keeps me busy and doesn&rsquo;t get tired. I feel like a teenage girl because I have fun with him.&rdquo;She said her family and friends were not happy with their relationship. &ldquo;Everyone stopped talking to me after we moved in together. But I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;Richard said he was struggling to get a girlfriend. &ldquo;I needed someone who could handle me, I never thought I would fall in love with someone older than me, but I wish I had met her earlier.&rdquo; He said Deliwe respects him. &ldquo;She cooks for me and washes my clothes.&ldquo;Our sex is better than all the young girls I have been with.&rdquo; The two are inseparable and they do everything together.
