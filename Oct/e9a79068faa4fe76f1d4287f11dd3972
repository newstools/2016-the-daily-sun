SEIZE the moment and bring back the glory!The words by Minister of Sport Fikile Mbalula were still fresh in the memory of Mamelodi Sundowns players when they jetted out of OR Tambo airport last night on their way to Alexandria to play Egyptian giants Zamalek in the second leg of the Caf Champions League final on Sunday (8.30pm).Downs take a massive 3-0 lead into second leg at the Borg El Arab Stadium after they humbled the five-time African champions at Atteridgeville&rsquo;s Lucas Moripe Stadium earlier this month.Mbalula visited the players at their final training session at their Chloorkop base on Wednesday.The minister told Downs players they were an inspiration to the nation: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve shown us that you are a formidable side. The moment of glory is on you &ndash; go take it. Rise and make history.&rdquo;He promised to support them in Egypt: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be in Alexandria to support you. Everyone in SA is proud of you. You are an inspiration to the next generation.&rdquo;Mbalula said he would reward the players: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m known as &lsquo;Mr Christmas&rsquo;. So win or lose you will be rewarded for your sterling efforts. But I know you will come back with the trophy.&rdquo; Mosimane said he was humbled by Mbalula&rsquo;s words of encouragement.He said the first 15 minutes would be crucial: &ldquo;We know they will come at us with everything they&rsquo;ve got to score a goal. But we must absorb that pressure. If we can do that, we must try to put them under pressure by going for an away goal. Zamalek know we have speed in the likes of Keagan Dolly, Khama (Billiat), Percy Tau and Anthony Laffor.&rdquo;He said he would not &ldquo;park the bus&rdquo; in Alexandria: &ldquo;I did not do it in any of our games leading up to the final, so why would I start now? If I was playing Real Madrid, maybe I might think of parking the bus, but not against Zamalek.&rdquo;He left Joburg last night a happy man: &ldquo;I had five days to prepare. That&rsquo;s sheer luxury. This is our dream and we are close to making it come true.&rdquo;Mosimane expects a hostile reception from volatile Zamalek fans, who sent death threats to all the Sundowns players in social media this week.He said: &ldquo;Our 12th man played a huge part at the Lucas Moripe Stadium and we know what to expect in Egypt.&rdquo;Mosimane said SA was overdue for success in the continent&rsquo;s most prestigious club competition.
