A SHOT rang out and Thabang was struck in the back.His friend, Tebogo Motsoeneng (28), tried to protect him but another shot rang out and Thabang Molefi (28) was shot in the head. Thabang died in Tebogo&rsquo;s arms. But Tebogo&rsquo;s day of horror was not yet over.The men forced Tebogo to take his friend&rsquo;s body from the tavern in Angelo squatter camp, Ekurhuleni to a disused mine shaft where they ordered him to push the body into the shaft. This is the same shaft where Bizolakhe Dlamini (18) was thrown three weeks ago.The killers are allegedly members of the Basotho gang, which is allegedly ruling Angelo squatter camp in Ekurhuleni. It is said the gang members shot Thabang because he played a Sesotho song, but not the original, which angered the gang.Tebogo contacted Thabang&rsquo;s family to tell them what had happened. And on Monday night Thabang&rsquo;s angry relatives drove from the Vaal to Angelo for revenge. Community leader Thandazile Qwabe said they heard about 16 gunshots ringing out at about midnight on Monday night.&ldquo;We were afraid to go out because it was scary.&rdquo; Two bodies were found on Tuesday morning. &ldquo;The bodies had many gunshot wounds. We reported the deaths to the cops.&rdquo;A resident, Vusi Ngwenya, said the gang members are cruel. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t think twice about killing a person.&rdquo; Tebogo, who is now in hiding, said he is traumatised. &ldquo;I will never forget this.&rdquo;Cops at the scene said they couldn&rsquo;t enter the shaft because of dangerous gases. They said they expect rescue workers to try and find the body. Cops said two separate murder cases were opened at Boksburg East Police Station.
