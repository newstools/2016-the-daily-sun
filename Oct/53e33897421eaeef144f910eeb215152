TAXI driver Thulani Gqirana had a tough time testifying in the murder case of Jayde Panayiotou yesterday. &ldquo;The way you claim to have come into possession of Sizwezakhe&rsquo;s phone varies. Two versions were given under oath. Which one do you want this honourable court to believe?&rdquo; asked advocate Peter Daubermann, legal representative for two of the accused.Gqirana from Uitenhage, Eastern Cape, was testifying against Christopher Panayiotou and his co-accused Sinethemba Nenemba and Zolani Sibeko. The men are on trial in the Port Elizabeth High Court for charges related to the death of Jayde, Christopher&rsquo;s late wife. They have pleaded not guilty to all charges.Gqirana was present when Sizwezakhe was arrested, but ran away with his cellphone after he heard gunshots.Gqirana struggled to explain why he told the cops and the court different stories. He had told the court Vumazonke gave him the phone because he didn&rsquo;t want his girlfriend to find it. But under cross-examination, he claimed Vumazonke gave him the phone to make a call to his girlfriend and tell her he was on his way.Daubermann said: &ldquo;I put it to you that you have fabricated your version of events. You have given false evidence. Your version now is different to what you said in your affidavit to the police.&rdquo;Gqirana said: &ldquo;I told cops about the cellphone. I did not go into detail as I did today.&rdquo;
