Police have started gearing up as students and activists begin to march to Parliament to protest university fees.&nbsp; UCT vice-chancellor Max Price has joined in on the march.&nbsp; Talking to News24 journalist Jenna Etheridge, he says of the current situation: "What do people do? They're desperate. When you're hopeless, you don't have stake in society. You just have to survive"Last year students surprised police and guards when they arrived in their thousands to demand that former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene and Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande listen to them. Nene was presenting his medium term budget policy statement at the time &ndash; the budget which is adjusted according to conditions since the first version presented in February. Last year the protesters got as far as the steps of the National Assembly before they were pushed back by police, and stun grenades thundered across the precinct. For this year's protest a large group of students attended a mass meeting on lower campus at the University of Cape Town (UCT) yesterday afternoon to prepare for the march. One of the main issues they had to organise was transport from Rondebosch to Parliament. Students with the Uber app or their own vehicles were asked to help out. Other options being looked at were the use of the university's Jammie Shuttles and public transport. Supporters from the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, whose Bellville students have been particularly active in protests this year, will be joining forces with their counterparts from UCT in the protest.'re hopeless, you don't have stake in society. You just have to survive"
