IT STARTED when his nipples wouldn&rsquo;t stop growing and soon it looked as if he had the perky breasts of a young woman.And if it does not stop soon he will have to start wearing a bra!He spends his days indoors, ashamed of how he looks, and when he does go out he wears a jersey no matter how hot it is.The sad young man from Mount Royal, Durban, who does not want his identity revealed, said his problem started a few years ago.He told Daily Sun he lost the love of his life early last year because of his boobs.&ldquo;She asked me about my boobs and then left. A few days later she dumped me.&rdquo;Whenever he fights with his current girlfriend she says that there is nothing he can tell her.&ldquo;We are both women,&rdquo; he complained.&ldquo;I went to the Poly Clinic in KwaMashu in June and nurses said it was a side effect of ARVs &ndash; but I don&rsquo;t use ARVs,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I fear I will be forced to wear a bra if they continue to grow.&rdquo;His mum (50) said he spends most of his time at home. &ldquo;This is destroying him,&rdquo; she said.President of the Traditional Healers&rsquo; Association Sazi Mhlongo said the young man should consult an inyanga for muthi to force his boobs back. When contacted, Agiza Hlongwane of the health department asked for the patient&rsquo;s contact number as they did not want to discuss a patient with a newspaper. The man told Daily Sun the department arranged for blood samples to be taken at King Edward Hospital. &ldquo;Doctors said the samples will be sent for tests.&rdquo; They said they would call him with the results. The department failed to respond to emails. The patient said he is getting help.
