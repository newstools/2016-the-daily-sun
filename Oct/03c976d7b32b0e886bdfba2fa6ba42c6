Mamelodi Sundowns defender Wayne Arendse sees no reason why Masandawana can't replicate their CAF Champions League exploits when they take part in the 2016 Club World Cup.This year's edition of the world-famous competition will be hosted by Japan and several high-profile clubs are set to feature, including 2015/16 UEFA Champions League winners Real Madrid.The 31-year-old is adamant that Masandawana can once again defy the odds after clinching the CAF Champions League title at the expense of Egyptian outfit Zamalek."Firstly, all grace to God who's given us the strength to conquer Africa," he told KickOff."I also see no reason why we cannot raise the bar and test ourselves against the world's best clubs."Remember, no one gave us a chance to succeed on the African continent and see what happened.&nbsp;"So, therefore I feel we have just as good of a chance as any other team in the competition," he concluded.Also taking part in the 2016 edition of the Club World Cup are 2016 Copa Libertadores champions Atl&eacute;tico Nacional, 2015/16 CONCACAF Champions League winners Am&eacute;rica and Auckland City, winners of the 2016 OFC Champions League.The winners of the 2016 AFC Champions League and 2016 J1 League (Japan) will also secure a place at the competition. -TEAMtalk Media
