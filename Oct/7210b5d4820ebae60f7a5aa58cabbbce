Sources close to the situation told Sunday Sun Thobile doesn&rsquo;t know Simphiwe is two-timing her with Boitumelo. But the star says he is in love with both of them. The source said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad that he&rsquo;s playing the two women like a soccer ball. I feel for Thobile because she thinks she&rsquo;s the only woman in Simphiwe&rsquo;s life.&rdquo; Other sources said: &ldquo;He almost died in a car accident when his car went up in flames while visiting Thobile. &ldquo;They both fell pregnant at the same time.&nbsp; &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s a sign that he should stop playing around and focus on one of his womenbaby mamas,&rdquo; the source told the People&rsquo;s Paper. Boitumelo said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time for this. I&rsquo;ll deal with Simphiwe. He&rsquo;s the one who&rsquo;s been lying to me. &ldquo;Simphiwe told me Thobile was in the past and I was the only person in his life. I know women love to play dirty. &ldquo;She should just get a job so it can keep her busy. &ldquo;If she thinks she&rsquo;ll last with Simphiwe, she better think again. &ldquo;That guy is f*cked up and useless,&rdquo; she said. For his part, Simphiwe said: &ldquo;Where did you get that info? With all due respect my brother I&rsquo;m in love with both of them and they know each other. They&rsquo;re both my girlfriends and mother of my babies.&rdquo; Thobile could not be reached for comment.Also read:&nbsp;'THOMAS MASHABA' TIES THE KNOT!
