NPA boss Shaun Abrahams this morning announced that charges have been dropped against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.Abrahams made the announcement during a press briefing held by the NPA at its head office in Pretoria. Gordhan had been expected to appear in the Pretoria Regional Court on 2 November on charges of fraud.On 11 October, the NPA announced it would charge Gordhan, former Sars commissioner Oupa Magashula and former deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay for fraud. The charges were related to Gordhan approving Pillay&rsquo;s request for early retirement.Following his announcement of the charges being dropped, Abrahams rejected the idea that he should resign.A protest march that had been planned in support of the three accused on Wednesday will still go ahead.The plans for the march have largely been driven by a group of ANC stalwarts calling themselves Save South Africa. The stalwarts include Cheryl Carolus, Frank Chikane, Sydney Mufamadi and Murphy Marobe. In a statement, the People's Assembly Against State Capture said: "Wednesday's rally will be a rally making victory in this battle, and consolidating the campaign against state capture, to stop the looting and corruption, and to restore the integrity of the state."Joining the rally will be the DA, EFF and other political parties; civil society organisations like Equal Education and Lawyers for Human Rights; faith-based organisations; and many concerned, ordinary citizens.Details of the march: When: 7am to 12pmWhere: The rally begins at corner of Francis Baard and Bosman Street, Pretoria.
