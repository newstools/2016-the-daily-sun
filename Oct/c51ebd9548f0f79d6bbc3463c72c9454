GOLDEN Arrows head coach Clinton Larsen has warned Orlando Pirates to be careful as they approach Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende in Sunday&rsquo;s Telkom Knockout Last 16 clash at Orlando Stadium (3pm).He said it would be foolish of Bucs to come at them thinking they were the same Arrows side Pirates beat 3-1 in the Absa Premiership a few months ago. The Arrows coach said they would be a completely different kettle of fish and could spring a surprise on Bucs.Arrows have had a good run since that loss and are unbeaten in five league matches, while Bucs have struggled in their last three matches, drawing all of them. Larsen plans to capitalise on this.But he cautioned: &ldquo;They are not a team to be underestimated. &ldquo;They are capable of turning things around at any time. We understand that they have not been at their best these past few weeks, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we will underestimate them. &ldquo;Having said that, they too need to be careful how they approach us. We are not the same Arrows. Our back four are among the best in the league this season.&rdquo;The coach is confident his charges will return with a win, proceed to the quarterfinals &ldquo;and ultimately win the cup&rdquo;. Said Larsen: &ldquo;In cup games you need to score goals. We will unsettle them by scoring first and mess up their game plan.&rdquo;Arrows will go to this match without striker Lerato Lamola, who got injured in their previous game against Chippa United, while Lehlohonolo Nonyane, who also sustained an injury in the same match, will undergo a late fitness test. Neither player was at training yesterday when Arrows hosted a TKO media briefing at Moses Mabhida Stadium&rsquo;s outer fields. But the good news is that their star striker from Zimbabwe, Kudukwashe Mahachi, is available for selection. Said the star: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m 100% okay but not fully match fit. I want to make it into Sunday&rsquo;s team. We know Pirates very well and have a score to settle with them.&rdquo;
