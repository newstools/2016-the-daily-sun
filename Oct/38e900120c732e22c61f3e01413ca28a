NEIGHBOURS often wonder why Melisizwe Taka keeps birds on top of his shack.&nbsp; But the 32-year-old from Mfuleni, in Cape Town&rsquo;s Khayelitsha kasi, has a simple answer: they&rsquo;re his alarm clock and door bell! &ldquo;The birds help me a lot. Every morning they move and make noise to wake me up around 4am. When I hear them I know I should wake up and get ready to go to work.&rdquo;&nbsp;Melisizwe, who works for a security company, said he has been keeping 16 grey and white pigeons on his roof for five years. &ldquo;The birds living on top of my shack make it almost impossible for anyone to come too close unannounced. My birds begin to move and make a noise when a visitor arrives,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Melisizwe said although the birds sometimes came inside his shack, they mostly stayed outside. Though he feeds them most of the time they can fend for themselves.&nbsp; &ldquo;They fly to the taxi rank and other places to look for food. But they always come back at 5pm when I get back from work,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Melisizwe first developed a love for birds in the Eastern Cape. He had 20 pigeons but some have died.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was so hurt to lose some of my birds. I suspect they were attacked by a cruel rat. I want to have more birds and build a bigger house for them. When I have the birds with me I really feel at peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; Godfrey Ncube (50), who sells vegetables at the taxi rank, said: &ldquo;I see the birds looking for food but didn&rsquo;t know they belonged to him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
