SINCE Friday the Kwa-nini family have been living in fear of jealous evildoers. Members of the family were traumatised when they woke up in the morning to find a cross stolen from a graveyard outside their house. ADDING TO THE HORROR, AN OWL WITH ITS INTESTINES REMOVED WAS TIED TO THE CROSS WITH BLACK WOOL!Mum of five Mandisa Kwanini (47) told Daily Sun that before the horrific discovery was made at her home in Khayelitsha in Uitenhage, Nelson Mandela Bay, she had warned her husband not to brag.&nbsp;&ldquo;He recently lost his job at VW SA and he was boasting that he was going to buy a 4x4 with his payout. &ldquo;I told him buying a car like that was like buying a coffin for our family,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I advised him to rather spend his money on renovating our house. I knew jealous people would make our lives miserable.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mandisa said next to the cross, which had an unknown dead person&rsquo;s name engraved on it, were a pot plant, a bunch of flowers, a mirror and a bottle of muthi.&nbsp;&ldquo;The front of the cross was facing my front door. We do not know who the dead man was. He was born in 1943 and died in 2011. The message was clear that someone in my home must die,&rdquo; she said.Mandisa said she was shaken, but she believes that God is on her side and no one will be able to destroy her or her family.&ldquo;Psalm 35 gives me strength when I am facing tough times. I believe God will protect us from these evil people,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;Mandisa&rsquo;s husband, Mlandeli (59) said: &ldquo;When I bought a brand-new bedroom suite on Thursday for R7 000 cash, the following day I saw an owl crucified and put on a cross in my yard! Some evil people hate seeing me go to town and coming back with important things. A witch is a witch, but I am not afraid of them!&nbsp;&ldquo;I will not stop living my life because of witches and wizards!&ldquo;I will never shut my mouth, because it was meant for me to use it to talk.&rdquo;Police spokesman Sergeant Majola Nkohli confirmed the incident.&nbsp;&ldquo;The scene was visited by forensics experts who will analyse the evidence. The outcome of that investigation will determine what action we will take. The family can also open a case of intimidation,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Sangoma Lifa &ldquo;Khandiyeza&rdquo; Noda said an owl was a bird that represented bad luck and darkness.&nbsp;&ldquo;When the bird appears at night it usually means someone will die within 10 to 19 days. Sometimes an enemy will bury the bird&rsquo;s intestines in a grave and hang the body facing your front or back door. The family must visit a sangoma soon,&rdquo; he said.
