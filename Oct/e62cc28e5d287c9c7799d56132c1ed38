KAIZER Chiefs coach Steve Komphela and his Orlando Pirates counterpart Muhsin Ertugral have denied that the Soweto derby has lost its spark.&nbsp; This comes following a dull goalless draw in their Absa Premiership clash at FNB Stadium on Saturday &ndash; attended by more than 72&thinsp;000 vocal supporters.&nbsp; The fans were left disappointed that neither side were able to find the back of the net and even worse, had gone into the break without any serious shots on target.&nbsp; The KwaZulu-Natal derby between Golden Arrows and Maritzburg United on Friday, which ended in an exciting 2-2 draw, was seen as far better than the &ldquo;overrated&rdquo; Soweto derby.&nbsp; Komphela reckons both Chiefs and Bucs applied themselves well: &ldquo;We tried to play a constructive game. One thing that we couldn&rsquo;t achieve was to get behind their defence.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t compare the KZN and Soweto derbies, because when you do, it&rsquo;s an insult (to all involved). This (Chiefs versus Bucs) is at another level. There is a lot we can rectify. I thought there was a couple of positives for us, maybe one or two negatives, such as goals not being scored.&rdquo;&nbsp; He reasoned: &ldquo;I cannot imagine a scenario where we say okay &lsquo;let&rsquo;s get goals, Chiefs and Pirates, let&rsquo;s not defend&rsquo;. You need to defend and attack in possession. When we attack I am clear about it and I am also aware of Pirates&rsquo; threat when we defend.&nbsp; &ldquo;There were lots of box and final third entries, wide and central. There was a lot of stress there. I am not saying we should not be slated, but leave something for the game.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ertugral congratulated his players for their hard work, &ldquo;considering we had some problems in the build-up to the game&rdquo;, with Luvuyo Memela and Oupa Manyisa pulled out due to a stomach bug.&nbsp; &ldquo;We observed Chiefs&rsquo; patterns and could have hurt them had (Thabo) Rakhale and (Gift) Motupa slotted home the chances they created.&rdquo;&nbsp; Likening it to a boxing bout, Ertugral said Pirates had three potential knockout moments, but scoring remains South Africa&rsquo;s main concern.&nbsp; He admitted, however, that he would take the point.&nbsp; Chiefs keeper Itumeleng Khune emphasised that they gave fans their money&rsquo;s worth.&nbsp; He said: &ldquo;We acknowledge that fans came in numbers and had to be entertained &ndash; they wanted to see goals. But at the end of the day both teams came up with plans which were well executed.&nbsp; &ldquo;There were box entries and we were well organised. They also blocked every shot we took at their goal.&nbsp; &ldquo;So we should not fault anyone, neither team were able to score a goal. Let&rsquo;s give credit where it&rsquo;s due.&rdquo;&nbsp; Khune was happy that they kept a clean sheet. He added: &ldquo;Every keeper wants a clean sheet. To be considered for a Bafana call-up I am judged on my clean sheets.&nbsp; &ldquo;The whole team has been doing well. It takes hard work, dedication and a lot of communication. We have a good understanding because I have been working with my back four for a very long time.&nbsp; &ldquo;We always tell ourselves we should not concede early. If it&rsquo;s a 0-0 scoreline the game may open up in the second half. We keep it clean at the back and our strikers score the goals.&rdquo;
