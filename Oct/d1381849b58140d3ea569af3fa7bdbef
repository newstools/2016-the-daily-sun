UGANDAN president Yoweri Museveni has described the International Criminal Court (ICC) as "useless", praising South Africa and Burundi&rsquo;s move to leave the tribunal.According to Lusaka Times, Museveni said: "It is a very good decision that South Africa has done that. In fact it is [the ICC] that is very useless." Museveni was visiting Zambia to be part of the country&rsquo;s independence celebrations that took place yesterday.South Africa dealt a heavy blow to the international court on Friday by announcing it was withdrawing from it.The ICC was set up in 2002 to help bring governments responsible for mass crimes against humanity &ndash; like genocide &ndash; to justice. &nbsp;However, it has come in for severe criticism, especially from African countries, which accuse it of only picking on African leaders to prosecute for crimes against humanity. Another big problem is that America refuses to sign up with the ICC, which means it is not accountable to the international law in the same way as other countries.South Africa&rsquo;s decision followed a dispute last year when Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir visited the country for an African Union, summit despite facing an ICC warrant over alleged war crimes. South Africa was the second country last week, after Burundi, to move to leave the European-based court. The decision is soon to be challenged in the courts.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/ugandan-leader-says-icc-is-useless-praises-sa-burundi-20161025
