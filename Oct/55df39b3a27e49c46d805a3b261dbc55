This is to make sure that we get the details of what could have caused the accident between the two trains.&rdquo;She added that the rail agency&rsquo;s focus would be on the family of the person who was killed and those injured.&ldquo;We are giving support to the family and would like to pass our condolences. To those who are injured, we would like to wish them a speedy recovery.&rdquo;On the other hand, police are continuing with their own investigations after cases of culpable homicide were opened in connection with the collision.Roads and transport legislature portfolio committee chairman Jacob Khawe said that more work needed to be done to provide the people of Gauteng with a safe, reliable and efficient transport system.
