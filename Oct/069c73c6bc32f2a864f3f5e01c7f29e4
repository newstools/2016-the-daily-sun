BUSI Khonde is happy with being single and living alone.But horny men keep knocking on her door. They all say they&rsquo;ve been told she is lonely and needs a man!The 48-year-old from Emzinoni in Bethal, Mpumalanga, claimed a resident is behind the rumours.&ldquo;I have been arguing with this woman for as long as I can remember,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Just last month, she attacked me and I was hospitalised for two weeks.&rdquo;Busi said she heard a knock on the door at the beginning of last month. She opened the door but found no one outside. And then the woman appeared and accused her of being &ldquo;evil&rdquo;. &ldquo;She said I would die like everyone who had lived in this house before me,&rdquo; said Busi. &ldquo;Then the woman threw rocks at me. &ldquo;I sustained serious gashes on my head.&rdquo;Busi laid charges and the woman was arrested but released again the next day. Now both women have filed protection orders against each other. &ldquo;She recently admitted sending men to knock at my door. This was even confirmed by another man who threatened to break my door if I did not open it. Police spokeswoman Constable Cynthia Mtsweni said the matter was withdrawn from court after Busi refused to answer questions put to her by the presiding magistrate. Daily Sun could not reach the woman for a comment, even after the SunTeam visited her house on two occasions.
