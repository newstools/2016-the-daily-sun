THE department of home affairs needs to stand up and tighten security at all South African borders. The request was made by Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini to Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba during his visit to Nongoma Royal Palace in Zululand, KZN on Friday.&ldquo;Intensified migration measures will play a huge role in decreasing the amount of drugs being smuggled into the country,&rdquo; said the king.Gigaba said he had noted the king&rsquo;s call and the department will do everything in its power to make sure that migrants don&rsquo;t get into the country illegally.He said the introduction of smart identity cards yielded positive results.&ldquo;We have arrested a number of people, ranging from migrants to our own employees,&rdquo; said Gigaba.He said with the new IDs it is difficult for people to commit fraud as the photo can&rsquo;t be changed.The king was quoted in a Sunday newspaper saying he was concerned about the way government appoints contractors who are using sand from royal land. The Ingonyama Trust administers 2,8 million hectares of land on behalf of the king. It was set up in 1994 to be the custodian of the land previously administered by the KZN government.Zwelithini said: &ldquo;I am talking about the abuse of soil by contractors who are doing work for government and who are trading in something they do not pay for. &ldquo;We are speaking about something that we see them taking. They should just say this road has cost so many cubic metres of sand so that we can also benefit.&rdquo;
