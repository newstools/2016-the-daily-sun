&nbsp;Even as he stared death in the face, Apostle Hans did not care that it might be his last day on earth.As gunshots rang out and bullets flew towards him, he prepared to meet his maker.But his pants were the only casualty! The bullets miraculously missed him and only tore his trousers!&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t scared. There was nothing to fear,&rdquo; said the man of God, who was more worried about his congregation. According to church pastor, Dr Howard Hans, they were in the middle of a prayer session on Friday night at the Faith Ministries International Church in Alexandra, Joburg, when thugs stormed into the church.&ldquo;There were many of them,&rdquo; said the pastor.&ldquo;They were armed with guns, but the congregation kept praying even when shots were fired.&rdquo;He said he was standing behind the pulpit and wanted to stop the thugs from interrupting the prayers so he rushed towards them. One of the thugs opened fire but the pastor was not harmed.He told Daily Sun it was the power of God that saved him. &ldquo;Two shots were fired at me but the bullets didn&rsquo;t touch me. They only tore my pants.&ldquo;The congregation was more surprised than scared.&rdquo;He said it was the first time in the 15 years since the church had been there that they had experienced something like this. The thugs took some collection money, cellphones and handbags belonging to women.&ldquo;Some of the bags were recovered. We believe more bags will be recovered soon.&rdquo;He said the people who came into the church were not members of the church.When asked if he feared for his life as the thugs shot at him, he said: &ldquo;There was nothing to fear.&rdquo;He said the robbers showed a lack of respect for the church and what they did in the House of God will bring curses on their lives.&ldquo;A curse will affect them and their children unless they come to this church to testify and be prayed for,&rdquo; he said.He said church members should not be scared of coming to church because security has been strengthened and even the police presence in the area has increased.&ldquo;People are free to come to church. It is entirely safe and services are going on as usual.&rdquo;Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said cases of business robbery and attempted murder have been opened.&ldquo;No arrests have been made but police are investigating.&rdquo;
