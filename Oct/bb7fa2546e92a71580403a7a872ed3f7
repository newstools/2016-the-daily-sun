Hlulani Mabunda was told she could make R720 000 a year if she invested her R120 000 inheritance with Jims Housing Projects.It sounded like a good deal, so instead of enrolling for a BSc degree as she had promised her dead parents, Hlulani put all her money into the project. Three years later, she still hasn&rsquo;t seen a penny of it.Hlulani (26), of Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, claimed the project founder, Mavis Baloyi, lured her into investing in the project on 14 March 2013. &ldquo;I believed I would get R60 000 a month, so I paid the money into her account.&rdquo;&ldquo;Mavis then moved from Thulamahashe to live in Joburg, and that was when she started being verbally abusive to me.&rdquo; She said Mavis claimed her bank account was hacked and she had lost R3 million.Mavis confirmed that she owed Hlulani.&ldquo;She is a cry baby. She knows very well that my account at Standard Bank was hacked and more than R3 million was taken in 2013. I will pay her all her money as soon as cops are done with their investigations.&rdquo; Mavis couldn&rsquo;t tell the People&rsquo;s Paper where the case was opened.
