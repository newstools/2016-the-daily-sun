Fees Must Fall students who plan on marching to the Union Buildings today will be doing so illegally, Tshwane Metro police says."They applied for a formal march and we did not grant them permission," spokesperson Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba told reporters at Church Square, where about 3 000 students were expected to meet."We might declare the march illegal."Mahamba said the reason the students were not granted permission was because they had not obtained confirmation that a representative from the Union Buildings who would receive their memorandum.The students had also informed the metro police that students would be coming in buses from different provinces. However, Church Square could only accommodate a maximum of 10 buses, Mahamba said.If they ignored this and continued to march anyway, a case would be opened and the organisers would be held accountable.He could not comment on whether police would attempt to disperse the group."Any operational decision might be taken. We cannot disclose at this stage what decision may be taken, but any operational decision might be taken at that point," Mahamba said.There were a number of police vehicles, including minibuses and nyalas.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/fees-must-fall-march-on-union-building-will-be-illegal-metro-police-20161020
