THE war against blessers has picked up.An international health initiative has thrown its weight in behind the fight against men who have sex with girls in exchange for gifts.The initiative falls under the American president&rsquo;s emergency plan for Aids relief.More than 2 500 girls and young women packed the community hall at KwaCaluza in Pietermaritzburg, KZN Midlands for an eye-opening debate that took place over the weekend. One of the initiative&rsquo;s ambassadors, Minenhle Dladla, said girls should be alert because blessers openly prey on them on the street, in clubs and in taverns. &ldquo;They want to bless girls with hair braids, shoes, clothes, cash and outings to fancy restaurants. Many girls say yes because they want to enjoy themselves and need the money.&rdquo; She urged the girls to use other methods to solve their problems.&ldquo;There are teachers and social workers who are like parents to us. They are always there to help us as children &ndash; there is no need to go to blessers,&rdquo; said Minenhle.Andiswa Moloi said: &ldquo;We need to take this information to heart and be more aware so that we can spot risks from a distance.&ldquo;Many girls depend on blessers to provide them with food, clothes, phones and so on. &ldquo;We can use the female condom to protect ourselves during sex, but the truth is that blessers will ruin our lives. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want to use condoms, so they pass HIV on to girls.&rdquo;KZN has more people infected with HIV than any other province in South Africa, and 12% of people between 15 and 24 are HIV-positive.There are also many teenage pregnancies in the province.
