THE EFF and United Front are at war with the ANC!Yesterday angry members of both parties called on residents of KwaNobuhle in Nelson Mandela Bay to march to the ruling party&rsquo;s offices in ward 47. The march started in Joe Modise kasi before moving to Poswa Street, where singing ANC members were waiting. Councillor Nontuthuzelo Skweyiya (68) stood far away from the protesters, who accused her of only serving ANC members.The United Front&rsquo;s Xolisile Peter (36) and the EFF&rsquo;s Thembinkosi Mfama (24), who both lost to Skweyiya in the local government election, led the march. Speaking over a megaphone, Peter told the crowd: &ldquo;The office of councillor does not belong to Skweyiya or any other political party. It belongs to all the residents.&rdquo; Peter complained that repairs to RDPs in Peace Village and Joe Modise were not being made and posts for a cleaner and a secretary in the councillor&rsquo;s office were not advertised. Councillor Skweyiya signed the protesters&rsquo; memorandum along with municipal speaker Jonathon Lawack. ANC branch secretary Luyanda Majola (44) said: &ldquo;These parties must learn to accept defeat.&rdquo;
