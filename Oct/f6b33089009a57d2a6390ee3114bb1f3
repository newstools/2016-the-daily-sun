DID you know this month is World Mental Health Month?The aim of mental health month is to get people to understand that mental health problems exist and should be dealt with.Zane Wilson, director of the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (Sadag) said mental health wasn&rsquo;t getting the attention it deserved &ndash; there is very little focus by government&rsquo;s mental healthcare services.While pharmaceutical companies do provide a range of beneficial medication, such as antidepressants, another treatment continues to be ignored: exercise. She said exercise caused your brain to release special hormones called endorphins which makes you feel better.&ldquo;The feeling isn&rsquo;t permanent, of course. If you miss a few days of exercise, your depression is likely to get bad again.&rdquo;According to Ivana Buchanan, national group fitness manager of Zone Fitness: &ldquo;The best part about exercise is that it is free.&ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s anxiety and stress or the chemicals that cause depression, people forget that exercise is a great stress reliever &ndash; and with repetition, can boost happiness.&rdquo; A 2006 report in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information found that aerobic exercises including jogging, swimming, cycling, walking, gardening, and dancing, have shown to reduce anxiety and depression.A growing body of literature goes so far as to suggest antidepressants aren&rsquo;t very useful in mild cases of depression. A 2010 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggested that antidepressants were no more effective than straight placebos in combating many mild cases of depression.As a first-line defence, a dedicated exercise programme can often be just the tonic. &ldquo;In South Africa, it&rsquo;s critically important to promote exercise as a healthy complement to lifestyle and appropriate medication,&rdquo; said Buchanan.With more than 100 000 members visiting her gyms, she&rsquo;s seen first-hand the benefits a regular gym routine can have on people. &ldquo;Exercise is a safe, healthy way of promoting your overall well-being,&rdquo; she said.
