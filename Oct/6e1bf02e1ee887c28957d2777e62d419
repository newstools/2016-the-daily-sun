Dear MizzB I am still recovering from being cheated on. I&rsquo;m no longer angry about it, but the pain still runs deep. It feels as if it happened yesterday. I no longer enjoy having sex with my partner because I keep thinking about him and his other woman. To make matters worse, they used our towels after they had sex. Now I&rsquo;m disgusted by everything in his room. Sometimes I wish he would acknowledge my pain without me urging him to do so. Although he apologised and is working hard to make things right, I just can&rsquo;t forget what he did. I wish I could wake up one day and no longer feel any pain when I think about this. &nbsp; Anonymous Dear AnonymousIt is hard to trust someone after they have betrayed you. This is especially true when the other person does not realise the damage caused by their actions. Your partner is clearly unaware you are struggling to forgive him for his cheating.
