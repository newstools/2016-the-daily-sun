FORMER Joburg ANC Youth League leader Patrick Wisani wants to bring an application for a discharge, saying the State has no case against him.The 30-year-old is on trial for the murder of his girlfriend, Nosipho Mandleleni (24), last year.He handed himself over to police two days after the murder, and has been in custody since he assaulted Nosipho&rsquo;s twin sister Siphokazi, forfeiting his earlier bail of R3 000.The State closed its case yesterday after calling its last witness, Dr Robert Ngude.Ngude told the South Gauteng High Court sitting in Randburg that Nosipho died from an excessive loss of blood. It is alleged that Wisani sjambokked his girlfriend to death at his Yeoville home. He also allegedly used a broomstick to beat her.After the State closed its case, Judge Ismail Mohamed told Wisani &ndash; who is representing himself &ndash; that there&rsquo;s a provision in the law that allows him to bring a S174 application for a discharge if he felt the State had no case. Wisani said he would bring the application and asked for a week to prepare. However, his plea fell on deaf ears, as the judge ruled that the application must be heard today.
