FREEDOM Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation yesterday said they had applied to court to have the charges against Minister Pravin Gordhan quashed. This morning, attorneys served an urgent application to have the recent criminal charges against Gordhan set aside, the organisations said in a joint statement. This is after we invited national director of public prosecutions Shaun Abrahams to give us more information about the charges or to withdraw them. He failed to do this, despite being given a week s notice. The organisations said the charges were without proper basis. Relating to the early retirement and re-employment of Ivan Pillay, a former SARS deputy commissioner, they are completely invalid, both legally and on any possible reading of the facts. The organisations suggested the decision to charge Gordhan revealed dizzying incompetence at the NPA and Hawks. They confirm our suspicions that the criminal justice system is being undermined to serve particular political interests. The organisations claimed their application is about protecting the machinery of the state from being undermined, thereby preventing further damage to the fragile economy at a sensitive time. NEWS24
