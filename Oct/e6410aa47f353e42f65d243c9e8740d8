At Borg El Arab Stadium, AlexandriaAll hail Mamelodi Sundowns, the kings of Africa!Last night the Brazilians became the second South African side to have lifted the CAF Champions League trophy winning 3-1 on aggregate against Egyptian giants Zamalek in their own backyard.Sundowns were crowned the African champions despite their 1-0 loss to Zamalek as they had done the job at home last weekend with a 3-0 victory. The newly-crowned African champions will now represent the continent at the Fifa Club World Cup in Japan in December.It was not easy for the South Africans, though, as they had to weather all sorts of storms to clinch the biggest continental club competition.After winning the first leg 3-0 at home last weekend, the onus was on Zamalek to take the game to Sundowns as they tried to reverse the scoreline. As expected, the home side was aggressive from the first whistle as they were chasing the scoreline from the first game last weekend. But Sundowns survived the onslaught with time delaying tactics at times which killed the momentum of the game.The home side showed desperation from the onset and did not waste time in launching their attack as they knew the only way back into the tie was to score goals and they needed an early goal to rattle Sundowns. However the Brazilians were prepared for anything thrown at them as they defended in numbers to the dismay of coach Pitso Mosimane. The Egyptians should have taken the lead in the 26th minute but surprisingly Stanley Chawuchi&rsquo;s effort narrowly missed the target with Denis Onyango clearly beaten.Downs suffered a huge blow few minutes later when they lost Onyango to a head injury he suffered earlier in the game and had to be stretchered off. His replacement Wayne Sandilands was tested in the 40th minute but he did well to parry the ball for a corner.Sundowns had their chances too as they caught Zamalek with quick counter attacks. Percy Tau brought out a brilliant save from goalkeeper Ahmed Mahmoud.With the home supporters becoming anxious with every Sundowns forward move, the Brazilians could not capitalise on Zamalek&rsquo;s frailness at the back.Khama Billiat, who was a constant threat to the defense with his pace and skill, also came close to silencing the supporters but to no avail.Sundowns did well to go to the break without conceding a goal and all they needed to do in the second half was to make sure they did not let in three or more goals.Zamalek were on the scoresheet in the 64th minute through Chawuchi&rsquo;s shot which beat Sandilands. But that was all they could offer and Downs emerged victorious.
