WHEN Jacob Chluname&rsquo;s dead body was found next to a tree yesterday, it was the next chapter in a drama that started almost three weeks ago.It is the sad story of a family desperately seeking help.Between the time Jacob (30) went missing on 30 September until his dead body was found under a tree yesterday, his family tried to save his life.Jacob from extension 5 of Simunye went to Westonaria, Joburg to withdraw money from the bank, but never returned home.Jacob&rsquo;s girlfriend Tselane Tabane (28) told Daily Sun she opened a missing person&rsquo;s case on 3 October at Bekkersdal Police Station.&ldquo;I gave the cops a photo of Jacob,&rdquo; said Tselane.Tselane and Jacob&rsquo;s sister, Flavia Chluname (24), did not hear anything until Jacob called Tselane on 7 October.&ldquo;He begged for help and said he was being killed. Then the phone went dead,&rdquo; said Tselane. His phone then went to voicemail. On 9 October, Jacob called again.&ldquo;Jacob said his hands had been tied up. I heard him saying he needs to go to the toilet, then the phone went off again.&rdquo;Tselane and Flavia told Daily Sun they went to the Bekkersdal cop shop and were told the investigating officer was off duty.Then Jacob&rsquo;s body was found. &ldquo;The cops said it looked as though he had been strangled. &ldquo;We are not happy when we were told the officer who could help us was off duty. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know why the phone calls were not traced. &ldquo;We think Jacob could have been found.&rdquo;A case of murder has been opened for investigation.Daily Sun asked provincial police cop spokesman Kay Makhubela what they should do about the allegations made against the cops. Makhubela advised them to raise their concerns with the cop shop&rsquo;s station commander.
