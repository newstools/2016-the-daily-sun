THEY named their squatter camp after former Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Danny Jordaan. They thought by doing so they would benefit!But that was not to be. Now the 52 families feel let down by the former mayor and soccer boss. Before moving to Bloemendal about two years ago, the residents were backyard shack dwellers. Annelie Tyrone (38) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;The area was named after Jordaan because all camps in this metro were named after politicians.&ldquo;Danny brought us the 2010 World Cup but he failed us. He promised we would be put on the housing database but nothing happened. &ldquo;The community decided to name the camp after him in July, a month before the local elections, in the hope that we would get speedy service delivery.&rdquo;Community leader Joel Brown (34) said: &ldquo;We went to Councillor Neville Higgins&rsquo;s office several times for help without results.&ldquo;We are the only squatters who don&rsquo;t steal electricity or water in this municipality yet we are being ignored.&rdquo;Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: &ldquo;The city cannot provide services to Danny Jordaan squatter camp because the land was occupied illegally. &ldquo;Provision of services has not been budgeted for. The city is registering the residents on the municipal database as required by law. &ldquo;They will be allocated houses when there are available sites if they meet the qualification criteria.&rdquo;
