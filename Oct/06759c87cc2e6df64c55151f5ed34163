WHEN they were approached by two cops to join a WhatsApp stokvel, they trusted them and thought they would make some easy cash. But now residents of Hillcrest, eThekwini are crying tears of regret. It seems they were scammed by con artists.The victims told Daily Sun they had lost thousands to the stokvel after being told in August they could double their money within a week. They said the WhatsApp group, called Money Maker Community, was started in February and had over 100 members. The victims said they were told to deposit cash into a bank account. One victim (29) told the SunTeam he lost the R6 000 he deposited in August. &ldquo;I was hoping to get R12 000 in the second week but this never happened. &ldquo;When I revealed to the group that I hadn&rsquo;t received my money I was immediately removed. &ldquo;That was when I suspected something was wrong.&rdquo; He said he was scared to open a case because both cops knew where he worked and he feared they would come after him. A 23-year-old victim said he lost the R3 000 his parents had given him to pay his college fees. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to tell my parents.&rdquo; One of the cops pointed out by the victims said he knew about the stokvel but had not started it. He said he lost R3 000. &ldquo;I know the people who are behind the stokvel.&rdquo; When Daily Sun asked for their numbers he promised to send them but never did.KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala advised victims to speak to the cops&rsquo; station commander.
