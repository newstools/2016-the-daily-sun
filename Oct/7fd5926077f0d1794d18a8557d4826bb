LET your pastors come and teach you if you don&rsquo;t respect the school rules.This is allegedly what a school principal at a high school in Jozini, KZN told Shembe pupils at his school last week.He allegedly told the pupils if they respect their religion so much that they don&rsquo;t want to obey school rules then they must tell their pastors to teach them.The principal was referring to pupils who worship at the Nazareth Baptist Church, where worshippers are not supposed to cut their hair.This follows the intervention by Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva, chairwoman of the commission for the promotion and protection of rights, who said the KZN Department of Education has to amend the rules. A parent whose child was sent home for not cutting his hair on Thursday said: &ldquo;We want our kids to get education yet we can&rsquo;t throw away our religion.&rdquo; He said his son always ensures his hair is neat.Thabo Sambothi, the church&rsquo;s spokesman, said: &ldquo;The Constitution protects religious practices. We ask the department to intervene.&rdquo;KZN Education spokesman, Muzi Mahlambi, said they will investigate the matter.&ldquo;It is totally unbelievable that a professional teacher can pass such a statement. If the teacher indeed passed such a statement, we will take drastic measures.&rdquo;Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said the statement undermined the Nazareth Baptist Church.Meanwhile, another school in the area had last week suspended a Shembe pupil who didn&rsquo;t want to cut his hair. He cut his hair and returned to school on Monday.
