UNTIL recently, it was impossible for lonely Bheki Mngadi (46) to visit his friends.He couldn&rsquo;t walk around his kasi because his wooden leg was falling apart.But thanks to SunPower, the 46-year-old man from Newlands West, Durban can visit friends again. Bheki received a new artificial leg this month.&ldquo;I am very grateful to the People&rsquo;s Paper for helping me get my life back. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know there were still people in the world who cared about the wellbeing of others,&rdquo; he said.Bheki&rsquo;s misery began in the early 1980s at Inanda, when he was shot in the leg allegedly by soldiers during a protest. His leg was amputated and he was given a wooden leg but 10 years ago it started giving him problems.&ldquo;I live on a grant and I couldn&rsquo;t afford to pay for a new leg. &ldquo;When I asked my neighbours whether public hospitals could assist, they told me I would have to pay so I stayed indoors and only went out to the pay point,&rdquo; said Bheki.In August the People&rsquo;s Paper published his story. &ldquo;After my story was in the paper, health officials came to my house and took me to Wentworth Hospital where they took measurements for my leg. &ldquo;This month I was very happy to receive a new leg,&rdquo; he said. Bheki&rsquo;s neighbour Xolani Madlala (39) said he was grateful to the paper for restoring Bheki&rsquo;s hope in life.
