Baroka FC will welcome Platinum Stars to the Peter Mokaba Stadium in a Telkom Knockout last 16 clash in Polokwane on Sunday.It will be Bakgaga's first appearance in the competition following their promotion to the Premiership last season.The Kgokolo Thobejane-coached outfit recently returned to winning ways with a morale-boosting away win over Cape Town City in the league.Thobejane expressed his delight with the victory but also wants a good result against Stars.He told reporters, "It feels great, but we need to be consistent. We have won, but the next game we have to win it too."A plus point for the side from Limpopo is that no players are suspended and the squad boasts virtually a clean bill of health.Meanwhile, Dinaledi go into the contest with an away record that is better than their home form.It has been a slow start to the campaign for coach Cavin Johnson's side, however, he feels his team is determined to turn things around.He told the club's official website, "The players are also fueled by the fact that we lost to Bloemfontein Celtic in our last match. It was not good advert for us as Stars.&nbsp;"We need to redeem ourselves. We are all aware of that especially the players and if we are able to do that then we will be okay."Striker Bonginkosi Ntuli remains absent for Stars as he continues his recovery from injury.
