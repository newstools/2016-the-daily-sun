IT WILL be war!The scene is set for an explosive Absa Premiership Soweto derby when arch-rivals Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs lock horns at a packed FNB Stadium tomorrow (3.30pm).Amakhosi top the standings with 13 points and unbeaten Bucs are fourth on nine points &ndash; but have a match in hand.The battle lines have been drawn and form goes out the window in this clash.Both teams are unbeaten in their last six matches in all competitions.But as both head coaches, Pirates&rsquo; Muhsin Ertugral and Steve Komphela of Chiefs, will tell you: A derby can make or break a player&rsquo;s career.Said Komphela: &ldquo;An early goal will be crucial. The big challenge for us is to stay focused.&rdquo;He said his players were highly motivated: &ldquo;It will be a mini war. The one thing you don&rsquo;t do is go there cocky, or you will get hurt.&rdquo;Ertugral, a former Chiefs mentor, stressed: &ldquo;I know the magnitude of the derby. We did not train hard, but smart, this week. I heard the game is sold out and we want to live up to expectations.&rdquo;There will a battle in goal between Amakhosi skipper Itumeleng Khune and Bucs&rsquo; Brighton Mhlongo, who have both been included in Bafana Bafana head coach Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba&rsquo;s squad to play Senegal in a 2018 World Cup qualifier in Polokwane on 12 November.Said Khune: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been training hard. There is no bigger motivation than the derby. It is one of the top five derbies in the world and every player wants to be involved.&rdquo;Bucs captain Happy Jele said: &ldquo;There is always pressure when Pirates play Chiefs. But it won&rsquo;t be hard for us to win the game, as we are ready.&rdquo;The battle will be won and lost in midfield, where Chiefs&rsquo; Willard Katsande and Bucs&rsquo; Oupa Manyisa will fight it out for control of the game.While Ertugral played down the fact his side rely on Tendai Ndoro for goals, he will be hoping Luvuyo Memela comes to the party.Chiefs will bank on the goal-scoring prowess of George Lebese and Bernard Parker.
