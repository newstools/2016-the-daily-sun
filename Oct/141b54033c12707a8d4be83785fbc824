THE popular Mafikizolo has become the latest and hottest South African export to the US and Canada.Set to perform in Canada&rsquo;s Toronto and Edmonton, the duo has already graced the US&rsquo;s Washington DC, Dallas, California and Indiana states with its hip Afro-pop sound.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already performed to two sold-out shows in DC and Dallas. California was also a full house. Our last show will be in Houston, and it&rsquo;s called the One Africa Music Fest. We&rsquo;ll be sharing the stage with big African names like D&rsquo;banj, P-Square, Fally Ipupa, Flavour and 2face Idibia,&rdquo; band member, Nhlanhla Nciza, told the People&rsquo;s Paper.&ldquo;So far, the tour has been amazing. Although the majority of people who attended were Africans, a large number of Americans also showed up.&ldquo;And as a result, the tour has opened opportunities for us. Already, we&rsquo;ve been invited to perform in New York next month.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll also be returning to LA next month for an awards ceremony, and have been invited by Radio KJLH to their annual LA Africa Music Concert happening in June.Nhlanhla said Mafikizolo would use this opportunity to market its music and to educate the US market about the African sound.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re working on our new album to be released next year. We believe it&rsquo;ll be a big one, as we&rsquo;ll be celebrating two decades in the industry. We&rsquo;re also planning a national tour and a live DVD shoot,&rdquo; Nhlanhla said.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re also promoting a new song from the upcoming album titled Kucheza , which means dancing in Swahili. The song is produced by DJ Maphorisa and written by Vanessa Mdee, one of the biggest female artists in Tanzania, Kly, an upcoming South African hip-hop artist, Theo Kgosinkwe, DJ Maphorisa and myself.&rdquo;Nhlanhla said the sound was different from anything Mafikizolo had done previously.&ldquo;We love exploring new sounds as we travel. We get exposed to new styles, but try not to lose our sound in the process. We hope our fans and supporters will love this new sound.&rdquo;
