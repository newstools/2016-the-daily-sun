THE Young and Ambitious Youth Programme will start today at Madiba High School in Kagiso, Mogale City. The programme, which holds workshops for boys and girls around Soweto, aims to reach out to the youth and make them more active in society. Founder Thembi Morapedi, a rape survivor, said: &ldquo;We offer the youth a platform to engage in conversations about issues that affect them. The programme aims to empower and protect children who are vulnerable to sexual violence.&rdquo;Today&rsquo;s workshop will include a motivational discussion and a self-defence course for the women participants. The organisation will also test out a new programme designed to educate young boys about the impact of violence on women. The boys will also be about gender stereotypes in an effort to prevent violent or abusive behaviour. Thembi said the sexual abuse of children is a huge problem in South Africa. &ldquo;When I was 11, I was raped in Port Elizabeth. I&rsquo;ve spent my whole adult life trying to understand why this happened to me and work out how I could prevent it from happening to others. &ldquo;Everyone should be doing what they can to stop the cycle of abuse. &ldquo;I realised the problem with the youth is they are not vocal about issues that impact them. That is why we launched the programme.&rdquo;Co-founder Dorah Mokoena said: &ldquo;The situation facing women and girls in South Africa is a cause for concern. &ldquo;From the feedback we received, we know the threat of violence and abuse is a daily problem. Many of our young participants voice the fear not only of being attacked, but also of the possibility of ending their lives.&rdquo; The programme will also be running workshops for girls in Soweto, Lenasia and Pretoria East from 11 to 22 November. A workshop for boys will run from 27 November to 3 December.
