MATRIC pupils at Mjokwane Secondary School in Naas have signed a pledge to do their best in the final exams. This follows a visit by Mpumalanga Education MEC Reginah Mhaule to their school last Friday.The MEC s visit aimed to encourage matrics to do the best in the coming exams.Nkosiyethu Mashaba (20), a member of the pupils representative council, said they are prepared for the final exams. Even though I m a bit nervous, I hope to do well because I have studied very hard throughout the year. Mhaule said she visited Mjokwane because the school has performed well in the past. But she expressed her concern that last year the school suddenly dropped from a 97,98% to an 87,54% pass rate. I came here to encourage the matrics to take the school back to where it belongs. Mhaule challenged the class of 2016 and signed a pledge with them. Please be reminded that this school is very old, and has a rich history of producing professionals who have contributed to the growth and development of our community. I believe that this poses a challenge to the class of 2016. There is nothing that excites me more than to visit a school that performs well and has well-behaved pupils. Sindi Dlamini, also a matric pupil, said she was happy that the MEC had encouraged them. I am also honoured that I signed a pledge on behalf of my classmates, Sindi said. I promise that I will not disappoint my school and my parents. I also promise MEC Mhaule that we will do our best in the final exams to make her proud of us. AENS
