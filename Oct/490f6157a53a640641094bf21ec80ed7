HE IS known as a supplier of Brentwood trousers. But this thug from Thokoza in Ekurhuleni does not buy the products he sells. Instead he spots victims wearing the trousers he wants to sell and then steals them! The smart thug apparently sits on a corner to spot victims to rob. Once he knows where his victim lives, he waits for him to leave his home and then pounces. He then sells the expensive trousers to his customers for just R300. However, the thug ran out of luck on Monday when he was caught leaving a room at Thokoza Hostel.Residents caught him, took him to a field and formed a circle around him before beating him with sjamboks. Hostel induna Joseph Zulu told Daily Sun he had received many complaints about trousers being stolen. &ldquo;They did not know who the thief was, but at last he was caught. He confessed to stealing the trousers to sell for R300,&rdquo; Zulu said.&ldquo;Brentwood trousers are strong and very expensive. The new ones cost R1 000. He sold them more cheaply because he was stealing them.&rdquo;Brentwood trousers first became popular with pantsulas in the 1980s. They came in many bright colours. These days mostly Zulu men like them because they last long and are easy to clean. After the thug was moered he was taken to a room in the hostel and kept until the police picked him up. A case of theft was opened at Thokoza Police Station.
