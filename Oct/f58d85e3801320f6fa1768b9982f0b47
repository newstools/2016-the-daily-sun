ALL she wants is to help deliver services to the residents of her ward. But Councillor Nokufika Biyela fears she will die before she can do anything. The 41-year-old from Lindelani, north of Durban, has hired bodyguards to protect her 24 hours a day. She told Daily Sun she had been living in fear since she started getting death threats shortly after she was elected in August. Nokufika said she arrived at her home on Sunday to find her furniture had been destroyed and there were bullet holes in her walls. &ldquo;I went to a meeting with residents in the afternoon and then I went out. My bodyguards and I were shocked when we arrived at midnight to find the doors unlocked and my furniture destroyed.&rdquo; Nokufika said a week after the local government election, she started receiving SMSes saying she was being watched. &ldquo;The last SMS said I must be protected all the time or I&rsquo;ll die. It really scared me.&rdquo; One of the SMSes, seen by the SunTeam, read: &ldquo;You are a dog and you won&rsquo;t make it. I know everything you are doing. That dog, who is your uneducated friend brought zombies to protect you. You must always be protected by your zombies.&rdquo; Nokufika said she didn&rsquo;t know who to suspect because as far as she knew, she had no enemies. She said the election campaign had been peaceful and nobody opposed her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why someone would want to kill me because I have done nothing wrong. All I want is to do my job in peace,&rdquo; she said. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of attempted murder was opened at Ntuzuma Police Station. &ldquo;No arrest has been made,&rdquo; said Zwane.
