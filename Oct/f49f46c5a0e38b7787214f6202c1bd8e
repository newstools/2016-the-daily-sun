A Durban Grade 1 pupil got a pencil shoved into his ear when a teacher allegedly slapped him, a local security company said yesterday.Private security company Reaction Unit South Africa head Prem Balram said his officers visited the school in Verulam, north of Durban, shortly after the boy was hurt on Thursday."His mother explained that due to the Grade 1 learner not performing [well] academically, his teacher assaulted him repeatedly on his head."The 7-year-old boy had a pencil in his hand and when he was slapped, it penetrated his ear and broke off."Teachers at the school claimed that the child may have been stabbed by another learner, however this could not be confirmed," he said.The KwaZulu-Natal education department said it was not aware of the matter but would send its district officials to investigate."If there is evidence of what is being reported we will take disciplinary action," spokesperson Muzi Mahlambi said on Friday.Police said the incident had not been reported to them.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/durban-pupil-7-gets-pencil-in-ear-as-teacher-allegedly-slaps-him-20161028
