ORLANDO Pirates edged Golden Arrows 2-1 in an entertaining Telkom Last 16 clash played at the Orlando Stadium yesterday.It was the perfect warm-up for Bucs ahead of Saturday&rsquo;s Absa Premiership derby against Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium. Pirates won more convincingly than the scoreline suggests. They produced one of their best performances of the season but again failed to make use of the numerous goal-scoring chances they created.Goals by Bucs&rsquo; Mpho Makola and Luvuyo Memela were world class, as was Wayde Jooste&rsquo;s reply for Arrows.Bucs looked in a different class as they tore into Arrows from the first whistle. What was refreshing was that both sides came to play attacking, entertaining football despite the hot conditions.Said Bucs head coach Muhsin Ertugral: &ldquo;We played well for 70 to 80 minutes but missed a lot of easy chances we created.&rdquo;His opposite number, Clinton Larsen, admitted Pirates took them by surprise: &ldquo;We gave it our all but Pirates played well and I wish them well in the next round.&rdquo; Pirates have appeared in three Knockout finals, winning the title once in 2011. Arrows have never won or reached the final of this competition.Ertugral reshuffled his defence following their disappointing 1-1 draw away to Polokwane City in an Absa Premiership clash last weekend.The Turkish born coach brought back Ghana utility player Edwin Gyimah at centre-back and former Arrows star Thembela Sikhakhane at right-back.It was Gyimah&rsquo;s first start since he had that altercation with Ertugral at the Cape Town Airport on 14 September following their 2-1 league win over Ajax Cape Town.Bucs were rewarded for their positive approach when Makola blasted home a well-worked Oupa Manyisa corner with a spectacular shot from outside the penalty area in the 10th minute, giving visiting keeper Maximillian Mbaeva no chance.The home side could have trebled their lead before the half-time break but both Memela and Tendai Ndoro shot wide.Arrows, who were under a lot of pressure, opted to hit Pirates on the counter-attack but failed to trouble keeper Brighton Mhlongo in a fast-flowing opening 45 minutes.Zimbabwean star Ndoro, who has scored six league goals so far, missed a sitter on the hour mark.But Bucs paid for wasting their chances when Jooste hammered home a superb free kick on the edge of the area on 63 minutes to level the scores. They breathed a sigh of relief as Memela won it with a stunning 73rd minute goal.- In yesterday&rsquo;s other Knockout clash, Baroka FC beat Platinum Stars 3-1 at the New Peter Mokaba Stadium.
