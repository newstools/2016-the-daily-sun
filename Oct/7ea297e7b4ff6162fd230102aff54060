SUDANESE President Omar al-Bashir is to appoint a prime minister, reinstating a post abolished after he came to power in a 1989 Islamist-backed coup, officials said yesterday.Granting certain powers to a prime minister falls in line with reforms proposed by a national dialogue held between Bashir's government and some opposition groups.Bashir himself had abolished the post of premier after he led a bloodless coup almost three decades ago against then premier Sadiq al-Mahdi with the help of Islamist leader Hassan al-Turabi.But on Wednesday, a top aide to Bashir told the Sudanese parliament that the president will now appoint a prime minister to head his government."The president's proposal forms part of changes to be made in the country's constitution based on recommendations from the national dialogue," said Al-Rashid Haroon.A prime minister is expected to be appointed within the next two months, officials said."This is a positive step because the prime minister will have some of Bashir's powers," Al-Noor Ahmed, editor of leading Sudanese daily Assayha, told AFP.Earlier this month, Bashir concluded a year-long national dialogue aimed at stopping attacks occuring in Sudan's border regions and healing the country's faltering economy.Sudan currently has a transitional constitution adopted in 2005, ahead of the country's north-south split in 2011 following two decades of civil war.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/sudans-bashir-to-appoint-pm-for-first-time-since-coup-20161026-3
