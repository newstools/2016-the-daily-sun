COPS in Pretoria pounced on Fees Must Fall demonstrator and EFF member Naledi Chirwa in the early hours of this morning for being in contempt of a court order.Chirwa is also one of four young women who staged a Remember Khwezi demonstration during an address by President Jacob Zuma's address at the IEC's results centre in April this year."They arrested her in a disgusting and disturbing manner," her lawyer Meshack Thipe told News24 just minutes after her court appearance.Thipe said an officer arrived to arrest the 23-year-old student at her home in Mamelodi around 4am, taking her to Brooklyn copshop without informing her of the charges she faced.Chirwa appeared before the Pretoria Magistrate's Court, where she was granted bail of R1 000 and told to appear again on 11 January 2017.Thipe said his client had spent most of the morning feeling confused, only learning of the charge she faced during court proceedings. He said she faced a charge of being in contempt of a court order. This is in relation to an interdict obtained against demonstrations at the University of Pretoria campus.Students have been protesting since September demanding the immediate implementation of free education."She was absolutely disturbed. I don't understand why they couldn't have waited for morning or at least last night? Why in the early hours?" asked Thipe.EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi slated the arrest, tweeting that Chirwa was taken from her bed, sleeping next to her infant child. He said this was done to terrify her so she would never question authority.The EFF leader decried the arrests of 600 other students who have been protesting.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/another-student-activist-in-court-after-disturbing-arrest-20161019
