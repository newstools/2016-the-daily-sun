PEOPLE on two different farms are facing similar problems.On Brakspruit Farm near Klerksdorp, North West, a farmer has allegedly dug a two-metre deep trench stretching around 314 houses on the farm, making it impossible for people living there to walk freely or feed their animals.The people claim the farmer cut off their water supply, closed off the graveyard and is making them suffer to force them off the farm. Lydia Koloane (52) and Jacob Mothobi (50) said they have been living there since 1981 and never had any trouble with the previous owners. They claimed new owner Gervin Lewis made life difficult for them and that Jacob&rsquo;s sheep couldn&rsquo;t graze.On Doornfontein Farm 10km away, Dorah Letlojane (73) claimed the farmer took her 70 donkeys and fed 61 of them to his lions. She added that farmer Jannie Van Deventer erected an electric fence inches from her house and she feared her little grandkids would be shocked. She also claimed the farmer cut off her water supply and sent workers to demolish her chicken runs. Dorah told Daily Sun: &ldquo;The farmer&rsquo;s wife said the fence would be moved and that her husband didn&rsquo;t want me to leave. I am staying here! This has been my home since 1961. My kids were born here, my husband is buried here!&rdquo; Van Deventer didn&rsquo;t respond to the SunTeam&rsquo;s calls or SMSes. Apparently, Cosatu secretary Job Dliso and ANC Councillor Mathapelo Seitisho have tried to intervene. Dliso said Lewis told them the trenches have been dug to prevent soil erosion and not to chase people away. Lawyers for the Brakspruit farmer said Cosatu didn&rsquo;t consult the land owner or the department of land affairs.They said an inspection at the farm would have shown the allegations were untrue. Lewis Trust lawyers Pienaar and Moolman said further legal action could follow.
