BLADE Nzimande said earlier this week that over 20 000 classrooms will be without teachers should students fail to complete the academic year.&ldquo;If trainee teachers don&rsquo;t graduate, 20 000 classes will be with no teachers by the beginning of next year. And the junior doctors who are hoping to graduate this year are at the forefront of service delivery,&rdquo; the higher education minister told Parliament.He said his ministry is working hard to calm down the student protests that have crippled some institutions.&ldquo;More than 80% of our universities are functional, though we are still concerned about those where lectures have been disrupted,&rdquo; said Nzimande.The minister thanked the vice-chancellors who have been doing their best while working under difficult circumstances.PAC President Luthando Mbinda said government must stop victimising students who are asking for what is rightfully theirs.The ANC&rsquo;s Cornelia September said whatever is happening at universities must not deprive the majority of students who want to finish their studies.Nzimande said he would look into the matter.&ldquo;When people criticise me, they must not act as if nothing has happened towards free education. Out of 12 million students in South Africa, nine million do not pay fees and are being catered for by government,&rdquo; he said.The IFP&rsquo;s Mkhuleko Hlengwa said the ANC promises what it can&rsquo;t deliver &ndash; that&rsquo;s why students are protesting.&ldquo;You got votes and now you cannot deliver. What was the plan when you promised people free education?&rdquo; asked Hlengwa.Freedom Front Plus leader Pieter Mulder said: &ldquo;Students who are serious about completing their studies must be allowed to do so.&rdquo;
