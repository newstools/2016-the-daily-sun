FREE State Stars substitute Armand Ella Ken wiped the smile off the faces of Highlands Park supporters with a late goal to draw 2-2 at Makhulong Stadium yesterday.&nbsp; It was not the start Gordon Igesund was looking for back in the Absa Premiership after he led his charges to the Telkom Knockout quarterfinals, beating Chippa United in his first match in charge.&nbsp; Edwin Sitaytayi&rsquo;s early goal together with substitute Thapelo Matibe&rsquo;s gave Highlands&rsquo; the lead.&nbsp; But Thokozani Sekotlong scored Stars&rsquo; first goal in the second half, just when the hosts let down their guard after their second goal.&nbsp; Ella Ken then added a second to steal the hosts&rsquo; thunder.&nbsp; Although neither of the two sides were dominant, the Lions of the North were more of a pain to the Stars defence, getting Ea Lla Koto&rsquo;s Thela Ngobeni working quite a bit, especially in the first half.&nbsp; Giovanni Solinas&rsquo; charges were unlucky on the day, they created several chances but their finishing let the Free State team down.&nbsp; Moeketsi Sekola will be kicking himself for missing an abundance of chances, a greater number than his teammates.&nbsp; Having an early, forced substitution might have had an impact on the visitors&rsquo; confidence. Sifiso Mbhele had to be stretchered off the field, a casualty of Highlands&rsquo; first goal.&nbsp; Stars continued their efforts to try find an equaliser in the second half, but Tapuwa Kabini&rsquo;s experience came in handy in helping his side hang on.&nbsp; The draw will give Igesund&rsquo;s men something to work on when they travel to Pietermaritzburg for their Absa Premiership match against Maritzburg United at Harry Gwala Stadium on Wednesday.&nbsp; They will need more than just high spirits to do well in that encounter, as United mentor Ernst Middendorp was watching and studying them from the stands
