EIGHT-year-old Tshidiso wanted to make his own wire car, but izinyoka cables have cost him his arm.Martha Malakoane (49) of Driziek Five, Orange Farm told Daily Sun she was in her shack while her son was in the field next to their yard looking for wire.He pulled a wire that he thought he could use for his car but it turned out to be a live electrical wire &ndash; full of dangerous power.His brother ran home to tell their mum that Tshidiso had been shocked by electricity.Martha ran to the scene to find her son lying on the ground, still holding the wire. A neighbour used a stick to pull the boy away from the wire. The boy was burning, with his clothes on fire and residents poured sand on him to stop the flames.He was taken to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, where Martha was told they had to amputate his left arm. Tshidiso also has burn marks from his head down the left side of his body. Martha said he had to go to hospital three times a week but it was difficult for her. She can&rsquo;t afford transport for both of them because she&rsquo;s unemployed. &ldquo;It makes me sad to see him like this. I hope he gets the best in life despite how he is now. It breaks my heart that I&rsquo;m unable to give him the care he should get. &ldquo;It hurts even more that the wires are still there, waiting to attack other children.&rdquo;
