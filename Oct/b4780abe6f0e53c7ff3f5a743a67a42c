THREE government employees accused of misusing their power have been arrested. Hawks officers on Wednesday arrested a police constable, a paramedic and a former Sars employee in Musina, Limpopo. They are facing charges of corruption, defeating the ends of justice and money laundering. Constables Prince Netshiavha (33), Thina Makhokha (35) and Azwindini Ramphambani (36) were arrested for the same crimes by the Hawks last week. They were later released on R2 000 bail each and will again appear before the Musina Magistrates Court on 29 November. The latest arrests allegedly involve cigarette smuggling into the country. The three were also accused of accepting bribes from cigarette smugglers and escorting the smugglers with ambulances and marked police vehicles to ensure the safe delivery of illegal cigarettes. Hawks boss Lieutenant-General Mthandazo Ntlemeza said: There is no room for corruption in government institutions. The suspects will appear in court today.
