A STAND-OFF between cops and members of Samwu took place in Tshwane&rsquo;s CBD yesterday. The marchers lost control and manhandled Tshwane&rsquo;s mayor, Solly Msimanga.What started as a peaceful march turned ugly, with rubber bullets and teargas becoming the order of the day.The workers started their march at Marabastad and proceeded to Sammy Marks Square to hand their memorandum to Msimanga before he attended a council meeting.First the marchers went to Church Square, where they expected the mayor to address them, but he did not show up.They then went to the council&rsquo;s offices in Sammy Marks Square, where they bumped into Msimanga heading for the council chambers. The angry marchers grabbed him by his jacket and tried to drag him, but the cops acted swiftly and started to shoot at the protesters and journalists.Determined, the marchers refused to back down and fought with the police, who fired rubber bullets and teargas.Eventually Msimanga went outside and accepted the memorandum from within the safety of a police inyala. He did not address the marchers.Protest leader Mpho Tladinyane said the mayor promised he would get back to them after seven days.&ldquo;If he does not get back to us by then, we&rsquo;ll see what&rsquo;s going to happen,&rdquo; he said.Their demands include that the city employ them permanently and that the municipality stop unilateral restrictions as well as outsourcing municipal functions.&ldquo;The city has shown tendencies of not properly consulting labour laws in line with the constitution of our bargaining forums. This is evident in clinics reporting to the department and no longer to regions. Nature reserves revert back to the central department and new shift systems at the Metro Police are introduced without consultation,&rdquo; he said.Protester Maria Mangena said they were taking back Tshwane. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want Msimanga. We are tired of being ruled by white people. They promised us permanent jobs, but look now!&rdquo; Offices and shops were closed because of the march.
