NATIONAL Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams is considering dropping fraud charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.City Press reported yesterday that informal discussions were under way to drop charges.The paper quoted sources saying Abrahams&rsquo; office had drafted a letter indicating his intention to drop the fraud charges before he appears in court on Wednesday.Gordhan&rsquo;s lawyer, Tebogo Malatji, was not available to confirm whether such a letter had been sent to them.NPA spokesman Luvuyo Mfaku has dismissed reports of intentions to drop charges.&ldquo;We deny these claims. Mr Abrahams is currently considering the matter and has not made a decision. He will make an announcement very soon,&rdquo; Mfaku told City Press.The paper reported a source close to Gordhan as saying deliberations were ongoing and an announcement was expected soon.Gordhan was charged with fraud for approving an early retirement payment to then Sars deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay.Pillay and another Sars official, Oupa Magashule, were also charged. Abrahams then invited the three to make legal representations for him to review their charges.Magashule and Pillay took up the offer but Gordhan refused, stating he did not believe he would get a fair hearing.Legal experts have described the charges against him as weak, saying they could not stand up in a court of law.In a dramatic twist last week Sars deputy director Vlok Symington was held hostage at their offices in Pretoria for disagreeing with the charge against Gordhan and refusing to sign an affidavit.The NPA had hoped Symington would be their witness.City Press reported that Symington has since been removed from the witness list. This is believed to be one of the reasons why Abrahams is now considering dropping the charges. These reasons were not, however, included in the draft letter.Meanwhile, a march to support Gordhan is expected to take place even if Abrahams drops the charges.
