AS THE hype around Tuesday&rsquo;s Durban High Court ruling on the Shembe leadership battle cools off, its leader is faced with the task of unifying the church. But Vela Shembe is not worried about the responsibility. He said ending rivalry among the church members was top of his &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list.His spokesman, Nkululeko Mthethwa, disclosed yesterday that an urgent meeting will be held in Mtwalume, KZN. This is when Vela and the church executive will take time to reflect on the judgment. &ldquo;Among crucial issues to be discussed will be a plan for how the two feuding groups &ndash; Thembezinhle and eBuhleni &ndash; can be reunited. &ldquo;It looks like an uphill battle at the moment, but with God it will be possible,&rdquo; said Mthethwa.Judge Achmat Jappie ruled that Vela was the legitimate leader of Shembe&rsquo;s eBuhleni group. The battle over the church leadership began in 2011 after the death of Vela&rsquo;s cousin, Vimbeni &ldquo;Uthingo&rdquo; Shembe.According to the deed of nomination produced by Vimbeni&rsquo;s lawyer, he had nominated Vela as his successor.The nomination was challenged by Vimbeni&rsquo;s son, Mduduzi &ldquo;Unyazi&rdquo; Shembe, who forcefully succeeded his father and claimed to have been nominated by him verbally. Vela took the matter to court and started his own church, Thembezinhle, which is based in Mtwalume.The eBuhleni members have made it clear they recognise only Mduduzi as their leader.Mhlaliseni Hlatshwayo, the spokesman for the eBuhleni church, could not be reached for comment. Hlatshwayo&rsquo;s phone was on voicemail when he was called.
