Two men got out of the car and asked me to stop as they wanted to ask me something. One of them quickly grabbed my bag. He was pulling it but I held on tightly. Unfortunately the strap snapped and the man ran with the bag to the car.&rdquo;Agnes said she went back to the bank in tears the next day to find out how the thugs could have known about her money as she is convinced the mugging was an inside job. &ldquo;But I was told the bank cannot help me because this happened outside the bank.&rdquo;Eden Park police said they were investigating a case of robbery.
