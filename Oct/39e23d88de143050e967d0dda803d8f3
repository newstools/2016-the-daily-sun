CECILIA Tshitlho has had enough of her boyfriend of 19 years!This comes after he allegedly demanded that the couple move in with his baby mama!The 46-year-old mother of four from Protea Glen in Soweto said she was the one who built their shack in the first place. &ldquo;It is meant to be our home not his place to do his shenanigans. I won&rsquo;t have that! &ldquo;Not under my roof, it won&rsquo;t happen.&rdquo;Cecilia&rsquo;s boyfriend, Judas Mdluli, has denied the claims.&ldquo;For starters she is lying that she built the house by herself. We built the shack together. &ldquo;All I asked was that if I ever had a child with another woman would she accept her?&ldquo;After I asked the question, she exploded,&rdquo; he said.Judas added that Cecilia has since left their home and also left the children behind. &ldquo;She accused me of cheating and being a bad person. To add to this, she does not want to answer my calls anymore,&rdquo; said Judas.Cecilia said she left because she did not want to meet the other woman. &ldquo;I wanted to give him space so that he can think about what he had told me. He can go and live elsewhere with whoever he wants.&rdquo;Cecilia said she is currently staying in the Joburg CBD and said when she goes back home, she wants Judas out of her shack.But Judas said all he wants is for them to talk.
