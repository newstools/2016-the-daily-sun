SIX years ago, Gabisile Mhlongo had the ancestral calling and went to thwasa. After she completed the process, she became a strong and gifted sangoma. However, tragedy struck two years ago when her ancestors deserted her and she lost her powers! Now, the 58-year-old from Eastfield in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, has turned to God in desperation. She has started praying every day and night to ask the Lord to put her back in contact with the ancestors. &ldquo;I have lost all I learned and my connection with the ancestors has been cut. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t read anything spiritually or help the sick,&rdquo; said Gabisile. She added although she blamed her bad luck on evil people testing her with their muthi, she also took some of the responsibility. &ldquo;I asked forgiveness from my ancestors many times and did some rituals. Whatever I did wrong to them, they must just forgive me. Strange things have been happening in my house and this must have contributed to the problem. I&rsquo;m asking the Lord to talk to my ancestors and make them come back.&rdquo; According to Gabisile, bad luck had been following her ever since the ancestors dumped her. &ldquo;I lost my job as a nurse and my partner died after a short and strange illness. I have lost everything and everyone important to me. Everything I touch just breaks into pieces. I really need help,&rdquo; she cried. Gabisile pleaded with SunReaders to help her with her problem.
