ELIZABETH George says evil people are trying to test her faith in God. The 69-year-old from Sharpeville in the Vaal told Daily Sun her home was hit by vutha two weeks ago while she was on her way home from a Sunday church service. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what these evil people want from me and my family. I have lost everything I worked so hard for over many years,&rdquo; said the devastated gogo. Gogo Elizabeth said she didn&rsquo;t know how the fire started. &ldquo;I switched everything off when I went to church. The fire started on the roof and worked its way down.&rdquo; Luckily, no one was hurt by the flames. While the fire was raging, community members tried to put it out but it was too strong for them. According to gogo Elizabeth&rsquo;s neighbour who didn&rsquo;t want to be named, it took three fire tankers to put the fire out. &ldquo;After the first one on the scene ran out of water, two more had to come. You can only imagine how powerful the fire was,&rdquo; said the neighbour. Gogo Elizabeth said: &ldquo;This was a very respectable family house. We need help rebuilding it, especially the roof. Anyone who can help or donate building materials must please come forward. We were left with only the clothes we were wearing.&rdquo; Andre Rout of Emfuleni Emergency Services said they didn&rsquo;t know what caused the fire. &ldquo;When officials got there, the fire was already very strong and the whole house was covered in flames,&rdquo; he said.
