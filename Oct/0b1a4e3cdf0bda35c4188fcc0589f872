AS THE alleged attacker was standing in court, gogos were protesting in the street.Almost every gogo from Bolotwa village gathered at the Ngqeleni Magistrates Court to see the 29-year-old man they suspect is the sole cause of their life of hell. He was charged with the rape and attempted murder of 75-year-old gogo Nomuntshu, who was attacked at home last Wednesday.According to neighbours, gogo Nomuntshu was alone at home when she was heard crying. The neighbours rushed to the gogo&rsquo;s house and allegedly saw the suspect fleeing the scene. Police arrived at the scene and discovered that the gogo had been raped and strangled. Community members claim that the suspect, who was arrested in Mthatha on Monday, had also attacked other gogos in the village.One of his alleged victims, a 60-year-old woman, said she was still traumatised.&ldquo;It was at night and I had gone outside to relieve myself,&rdquo; cried the gogo.When she went back into the house, she switched on the lights and saw him. &ldquo;When I started shouting, asking him what he wanted, he started attacking me with an axe,&rdquo; she said. The man allegedly overpowered her and raped her.Resident Maphelo Vava alleged this was not the man&rsquo;s first rape but it was difficult to arrest him because of lack of evidence.
