WATER shortages have forced eThekwini Municipality to acquire a R700 million loan. A R93 million grant will also be given to the municipality.This follows numerous protests by residents of Adams Mission, Waterloo and KwaMakhutha who have been waking up to dry taps. On Wednesday, the municipality signed an agreement with the funders at the Durban City Hall.Municipal spokeswoman Tozi Mthethwa said the R93 million grant will be received on Tuesday from the Infrastructure Investment Programme for South Africa. The R700 million has been split into two R350 million loan agreements. It was sourced from the Development Bank of South Africa and the French Development Agency. City manager Sibusiso Sithole said: &ldquo;These loans are confirmation that the municipality&rsquo;s finances are in good order. &ldquo;That is why these financial institutions have given us funding.&ldquo;The money will contribute to programmes that will ensure residents and businesses have a reliable water supply.&rdquo; Sebenzile Mngoma (37), a resident of Golokodo, is not sure whether the funding will benefit the community. She said: &ldquo;I hope the money is used to address water shortages in eThekwini, instead of filling the pockets of municipal officials.&rdquo;
