KWAITO star Mgarimbe is gatvol with Dreamteam!&nbsp; Mgarimbe, real name Nkosinathi Mfeka, is not impressed by Afrotainment&rsquo;s rap group.&nbsp; He claimed Dreamteam hijacked his song, Gologo noBeer, which he recorded with Cassper Nyovest .&nbsp; He said: &ldquo;So these guys decided to take my song after they heard me record it with Cassper and performed it at Taboo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cassper and I released the track online three weeks ago. The next thing, Dreamteam releases Ubumnandi a week later with my lyrics on it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He continued: &ldquo;Last week I got the shock of my life when I received calls from people telling me Dreamteam actually performed my song on Live Amp.&nbsp; &ldquo;They demanded to know whose track it is.&nbsp; &ldquo;I feel disrespected by these boys.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dreamteam member, Trevor &ldquo;TrevorTrey&rdquo; Sineke, said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to entertain this.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he feels we stole his track, it&rsquo;s fine.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was drunk when we were with him at Taboo.&rdquo;&nbsp;Listen to both tracks here:&nbsp;
