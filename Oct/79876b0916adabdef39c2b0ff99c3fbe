IN THE video four young men are lying on the ground. One may&nbsp;already be dead. Another is defiant, but pleading.&nbsp;For some time, the people seem uncertain, waiting, with the fate of the suspected robbers hanging in the balance.&nbsp; THEN, AS IF BY A SECRET SIGNAL, THE PEOPLE SURGE FORWARD AND DEATH STEPS IN. Residents of Rabie Ridge in Ekurhuleni all told Daily Sun the same story. They reported an unbearable crime rate and said a gang of young men, no more than boys, were terrorising and stealing from people.&nbsp; They spoke of their frustration at a legal system incapable of protecting them. &ldquo;We have been living in fear for too long. These boys are making our lives hell,&rdquo; said resident Thato Setsogo (45). &ldquo;They rob us and rape our children. We have reported the matter to the police several times but had no help. We can&rsquo;t be living in fear in our own community.&rdquo; On Thursday, when people heard that the gang had gathered at the bottle-store on the corner, they went there and found the four boys they suspected were the thieves.&nbsp; The boys were brutally beaten with all sorts of weapons.&nbsp; In a video, people can be heard telling the boys to return the money and things they stole. As things get totally out of control, two of the young men are beaten to death and the other two land up in ICU. Resident Thuso Mudau (57) said: &ldquo;We need to set an example and show the thugs we are not going to be intimidated by them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Clearly, the police are not willing to work with the community. We are setting an example. This is the only way these boys and anybody else will learn.&rdquo; But a friend of the boys says it was a case of mistaken identity.&nbsp; &ldquo;The people being beaten up in that video are not criminals or gangsters.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are my friends who go to school with me. I know the people being beaten up there are not the criminals. They were in the wrong place at the wrong time,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;Now I fear I may also be in danger as the people say they are not done and are still looking for more suspects.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rabie Ridge police spokesman Captain Mofana Masela told Daily Sun: &ldquo;The police are still investigating and looking for the suspects.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said they condemned the people&rsquo;s actions. &ldquo;The wrong people end up being killed.&nbsp; &ldquo;The people must not take the law into their own hands. We appeal to them to report any crimes to the police so the right actions may be taken and the guilty people can be caught.&rdquo;&nbsp;
