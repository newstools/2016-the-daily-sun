THE THUGS didn&rsquo;t want him to die. They said his flesh would make better muthi if he was alive. THEN THEY CUT OFF HIS LITTLE FINGER WITH PLIERS.&nbsp;Wonder Nkosi (34) from Yeoville, Joburg told Daily Sun that as an albino, he knew he faced dangers many other people didn&rsquo;t. Wonder&rsquo;s story of horror started when he was walking along Rocky Street at about 5am last Thursday when a car with four men stopped next to him. &ldquo;The driver called me to the car and opened the window. I thought they wanted directions but I soon found out they were after me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As I leaned towards him, two passengers jumped out and grabbed me and forced me into the car.&rdquo; He said they tied his hands behind his back and stuffed a T-shirt into his mouth so he couldn&rsquo;t scream. &ldquo;I listened to them talking about whether they should kill me or not,&rdquo; said Wonder. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even describe how scared I was. One of them said muthi from my body wouldn&rsquo;t be strong if I died so they decided they wouldn&rsquo;t kill me. They said they only needed my finger.&rdquo; Then they bent him forward so they could reach his hands and then Wonder felt the worst pain he had ever felt in his life. &ldquo;They held my left hand and used some sort of pliers to cut off my finger. The pain was terrible but there was nothing I could do.&rdquo; While the car was still moving they opened the car door and threw him out. He managed to untie himself and found his way home. Wonder said he is living in fear. He doesn&rsquo;t know when evil people may target him again. A case of kidnapping was opened at the Yeoville Police Station and the cops were still investigating. Nomasonto Mazibuko, executive director at the Albinism Society of South Africa, said they passionately condemn these kinds of acts. &ldquo;As the Albinism Society of South Africa we are really hurt by what happened to Wonder but it is a reality that such things still exist in our communities. &ldquo;We would like to meet him and help him to overcome his fears after what happened to him.&rdquo;
