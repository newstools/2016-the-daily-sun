IT&rsquo;S common for motorists involved in an accident to exchange blows. However, yesterday it was a bystander who allegedly became a victim when he was shot dead by one of the motorists. According to witnesses at the scene, the 32-year-old bystander had witnessed the accident. So when the two drivers whose cars, a municipal truck and a private car, got into a heated argument, the pedestrian tried to intervene. The two collided at the intersection of Albert Wessel Drive and Faraday Streets between Newcastle and Madadeni in the KZN Midlands. &ldquo;He apparently gave testimony of what he witnessed. The driver of the small vehicle felt he was siding with the truck driver. He allegedly drew a gun and shot the bystander dead,&rdquo; said Mabanga. He said when he and the other residents gathered at the scene the deceased&rsquo;s lifeless body was already cold on the side of the road. &ldquo;If the version of the story we heard is correct it really was unfortunate for the poor guy to die in such a brutal manner while trying to assist. Nqobile Gwala, KZN police spokesman, confirmed the incident and said a case of murder had been opened at Newcastle Police Station.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alleged that the incident happened at about 7am where the deceased was fatally shot by the suspect after a heated argument.&ldquo;A 42-year-old suspect was arrested after the shooting and charged with murder. He will appear in the Newcastle Magistrates Court soon.&rdquo;Daily Sun requested comment from Newcastle municipal spokeswoman Nomfundo Khawula, but she failed to comment in time for print.
