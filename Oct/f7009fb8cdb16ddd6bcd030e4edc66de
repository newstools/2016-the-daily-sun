THE Phungashe Education and Resource Centre was a beacon of hope for local school kids.After it opened in July 2011, many kids went there to use the science lab and library and to get access to the internet.But since it closed six months ago because of water and sanitation problems, the kids have been left to suffer.Parents of high school pupils in Phungashe, near Highflats, southern KZN are worried about the effects that the closure of the centre will have on their kids&rsquo; school performance.Siziwe Mavundla (48) told Daily Sun her daughter (19) who is doing Matric this year has been badly affected by the closure.&ldquo;She used to go to the centre on weekends to do research on the internet and her science teacher used to take them there to do experiments. &ldquo;Since it closed, she had been struggling to get internet access because she can&rsquo;t afford to buy data bundles on her phone. If she fails Matric, it will be because of the closure of the centre,&rdquo; said Siziwe.Another parent said they wanted the KZN Department of Education to urgently intervene.&ldquo;Since the centre closed my son who is in grade 11 has been struggling. His marks in English and geography have dropped,&rdquo; said the parent.When the SunTeam visited the centre on Wednesday, a worker who refused to give her name confirmed it was closed.A notice of the centre&rsquo;s closure has been placed on the main entrance, stating that it would remain closed until further notice due to sanitation problems.When contacted earlier, Sicelo Khuzwayo, spokesman for KZN Education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana, said: &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t want to give a general comment. I want to give you something tangible. Call me after 30 minutes.&rdquo;But later his phone rang unanswered.
