IT SEEMS former Kaizer Chiefs player, Jimmy Tau, knows how to score on and off the field!According to Sunday Sun sources, the former Amakhosi skipper has found love in the arms of SABC newsreader, Thabile Ngwato.A source claimed Jimmy frequents the SABC studios to see her.&ldquo;I hope she&rsquo;ll heal his heart,&rdquo; the source said. &ldquo;He went through a nasty break-up with his ex, Sizakele Manonga, three months ago.&rdquo;Jimmy was rumoured to have paid R200 000 ilobolo for Sizakele.The source added that what started as a regular business chat had evolved into a relationship.&ldquo;At first, we thought Jimmy was about to make his return to the SABC,&rdquo; the source said.&ldquo;But over the past few weeks, they&rsquo;ve been hanging out. Jimmy even brings her lunch.&rdquo;A source close to Thabile claimed she was keeping her affair under wraps to avoid drama.&ldquo;She&rsquo;s taking things slow to avoid unnecessary attention from her media colleagues,&rdquo; the source said.A third source claimed the couple&rsquo;s attempts to hide their steamy affair aren&rsquo;t really working.&ldquo;They flirt whenever Jimmy visits her at work.
