THE first lady of West Ink Records, Babes Wodumo, has allegedly been banned by the SABC.But the SABC knows nothing about it.After much public outcry, the public broadcaster allegedly decided to ban Babes Wodumo&rsquo;s single, titled Mercedes.Sunday Sun was the first publication to report that the song had music fans divided when it was released last month.Many people complained about the song, saying it was promoting a deadly street drug, known in Durban as &ldquo;umgwinyo&rdquo; or &ldquo;data&rdquo;.In a statement released to the media yesterday, KZN's MEC for Social Development, Weziwe Thusi, welcomed the banning of the kwaito song.Thusi said: &ldquo;We live in difficult times where our children are heavily involved in substance abuse and we can&rsquo;t afford to have songs that can be mistaken as promoting drug abuse.&ldquo;This year, two children lost their lives to drugs after a house party in KwaMashu. We welcome this bold and progressive step by management at the SABC.&rdquo;Babes has continuously denied the song is promoting the abuse of the said drug, saying it&rsquo;s about her favourite car.The MEC further called on artists to become activists and use their craft to spread positive messages.But SABC spokesperson, Kaizer Kganyago, denied they have banned the song.&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way we can do that. That information is not true. I don&rsquo;t even know the song for that matter. I&rsquo;m not aware of the matter, I&rsquo;ll comment once I have full details,&rdquo; he said.Babes Wodumo's phone rang unanswered.
