The Nike brand protection manager was at the scene to identify their brand. The value of the seized items is R5 million.&rdquo; He added that the owner of the factory will be summoned to appear in the Durban Specialised Commercial Court to face a charge of Contravention of the Counterfeit Goods Act of 1997.In June this year, Daily Sun ran a story about R900 000 worth of fake label clothes that were found at a factory in the Durban CBD. Mhlongo said they had received a complaint about the fake clothes, after hawkers were seen selling the &ldquo;branded&rdquo; clothes.
