LITTLE Siyabonga Mlambo is back in his relieved parents&rsquo; arms. But the woman who had been the 14-month-old&rsquo;s nanny since he was born is behind bars with two of her cousins. The baby from Protea Glen extension 13 in Soweto was found in KZN on Friday after he was kidnapped at his home the previous day. Major-General Frank Kekana said: &ldquo;On Thursday night, we received a call saying the missing child could be in Newcastle. Police went to the area and arrested two men, who are cousins of the nanny.&rdquo; Kekana said the two men would be charged with robbery and kidnapping. &ldquo;Further questioning revealed the nanny was involved. She was locked up and is also facing kidnapping charges,&rdquo; he said. Siyabonga&rsquo;s mum, Mandisa (29) said she never suspected her nanny might be involved.&ldquo;After two men left with Siyabonga, the nanny was crying and praying with me. I am shocked to find out she allegedly organised the whole thing,&rdquo; she said.
