THE ANC yesterday dismissed chief whip Jackson Mthembu&rsquo;s call for the NEC to resign, saying the NEC was elected by ANC branches. &ldquo;It is accountable to the branches,&rdquo; said party spokesman Zizi Kodwa.In a shocking move, Mthembu called on the whole ANC executive leadership to step down, telling City Press the current leadership of the governing party was worse than its apartheid predecessors. He has also slammed the use of state organs to settle political scores, referring to Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan, who is currently facing fraud charges.Mthembu says he&rsquo;s been silent for too long, and the time has now come for the ANC to make changes.He warned that the party may find itself out in the cold after the 2019 national elections. Mthembu gave a lengthy interview on Sunday morning, outlining his position. &ldquo;When I said the entire ANC leadership must take the fall I meant everybody, myself included,&rdquo; Mthembu told eNCA.&ldquo;As the ANC leadership we must take a collective fall. The way we&rsquo;re pursuing Pravin, from that angle we&rsquo;re worse than the apartheid regime,&rdquo; Mthembu said.&ldquo;This is not what you expect from a democratic state, particularly a movement that fought for liberation. &ldquo;If we are taking collective responsibility for the mess we created then we must take a collective fall from grace. By charging Pravin we are instead showing a middle finger to our people,&rdquo; he said.Kodwa said those ANC members making public comments gave the impression that the organisation was &ldquo;divided&rdquo;.According to the City Press report, the ANC is at odds over the pending prosecution of Gordhan, whose fraud case is set down for 2 November. Mthembu&rsquo;s remarks has excited the DA, which plans to table a motion of no confidence against Zuma this week. The party has called on Mthembu to walk the talk.
