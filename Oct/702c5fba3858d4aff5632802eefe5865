THUGS, stay away from this park or the security doll will get you!This is the warning given by William Maponya (75) of Winterveld, near Mabopane in Tshwane, who has placed his lucky doll in a park he made.According to the madala, the doll prevents people from littering in his park and chases away thugs.He said when he opened the park, itwas an easy target for criminals. But thanks to his doll, he has not been robbed for the past six months.William said he made the park from an area that people used as a dumpsite. He decided to clean the spot and look after it.&ldquo;There are no parks or day-care centres in the area, and most of the children here don&rsquo;t attend school. &ldquo;The park is a safe place for them to play and enjoy themselves,&rdquo; said William.He said he also relaxes at the park with his friends on weekends and public holidays.He even bought new chairs and a table and planted trees to make the park beautiful. But thugs stole the furniture.&ldquo;I put a fence around the park, but the tsotsis still broke in,&rdquo; he said.That&rsquo;s when he decided to get the security doll to scare them away.&ldquo;Thugs no longer come to my park at night because they are scared of the doll. &ldquo;If they ever come here, there will be hell to pay.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if they believe in magic, but this time I am prepared for them.&ldquo;I laugh whenever people ask me what the doll is for. &ldquo;I tell them to cause trouble in the park if they want to find out.&rdquo;
