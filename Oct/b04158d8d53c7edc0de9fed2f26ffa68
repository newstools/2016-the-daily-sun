YOU need strong nerves to use this public toilet!On a busy city street in Basel, Switzerland there is a public restroom that is see-through from the inside but a mirror on the outside. This means you can see the world go by as you answer nature&rsquo;s call, but the people walking by can&rsquo;t see you.It started life as an art installation in London, England by architect Monica Bonvicini in 2003 &ndash; the world&rsquo;s first see-through loo. It was later moved to Switzerland, where it is still in use.
