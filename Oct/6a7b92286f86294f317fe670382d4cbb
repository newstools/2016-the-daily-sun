When I came back on Friday evening I was welcomed by a bad smell and flies in front of his bedroom door. I called him to find out what was happening, but there was no answer. &ldquo;When I opened the door I found him lying on the floor, dead.&rdquo; At the time, said Johanna, the other member of her family was hiding behind the toilet.&ldquo;We called him to find out what had happened. He was scared and wouldn&rsquo;t say a word. I immediately called the neighbours, who called the police.&ldquo;I adopted him when he was three years old after his mum died. He has never gone to bed on an empty stomach but that was never enough for him. &ldquo;I have forgiven him countless times but I have no love left for him now.&rdquo; Temba police spokesman Constable Herman Moremi said a case of murder had been opened.&ldquo;The suspect has been arrested and will appear in the Moretele Magistrates Court.&rdquo;
