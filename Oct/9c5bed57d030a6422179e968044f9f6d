BIDVEST Wits head coach Gavin Hunt is frustrated!What is worrying the Clever Boys mentor is the stop-start season, which is killing his side&rsquo;s momentum.Wits will have played four matches in the space of 10 days by next Tuesday &ndash; and then face another three week lay-off in November due to another Fifa international break.The mini-marathon started at Goble Park last Saturday where the Clever Boys were beaten 3-1 by Free State Stars in the Telkom Knockout Last 16.Tonight the Students are on the road again, this time to the Cape Town Stadium to play struggling Ajax Cape Town in an Absa Premiership clash (7.30pm). On Saturday they travel to the Free State capital for a clash with Bloemfontein Celtic and they round off a testing 10 days at home to Chippa United next Tuesday.Said Hunt: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really frustrating with all these breaks.&rdquo;Wits are facing a fixture pile-up. Hunt&rsquo;s charges have played only three league matches while most other sides have completed six rounds. Their league match against new Caf Champions League winners Mamelodi Sundowns on 7 December has also been postponed. Downs will be playing in the Fifa World Club Cup in Japan from 8-18 December. Hunt said he had a heart-to-heart chat with his players following their loss to Stars but added: &ldquo;That game came after another three-week lay-off. So it&rsquo;s not really the players&rsquo; fault. I might change the shape a bit. We have to bounce back.&rdquo;Hunt admitted he was wary about the Urban Warriors, who are looking for their first win in five starts. They have two draws, three losses and are second from bottom.The coach added: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be making major changes. I might have to rest players later in the week but not against Ajax. It&rsquo;s always difficult playing against sides like Ajax. They will be dangerous. What we have to do is play clever and be smart.&rdquo;
