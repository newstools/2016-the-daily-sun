AS THE #FeesMustFall protests continue, the future of close to a million matriculants hangs in the balance.Matrics who hope to gain access to tertiary education next year based on their final exams might not be able to pursue their university studies as some campuses have ground to a halt.Refiloe Motsamai (17) from Kwadedangedlale High School in Zola, Soweto, is one of them.She said she had prepared well for the exams that start tomorrow and hopes to pass with flying colours to gain entry to university next year. But her chances of pursuing her studies may be smashed by ongoing protests. Protesting students have so far indicated that they won&rsquo;t back down from their demand for free education.&ldquo;I have already received provisional acceptance from the University of Joburg,&rdquo; said Refiloe.Another matric, Katlego Diau from Letare Senior Secondary School in Moletsane, Soweto, said she was ready for the exams and had applied to study for a diploma in human resource management. The minister in the office of the presidency, Jeff Radebe, on Friday said that should the academic year be lost, almost a million matriculants would not be admitted to higher education next year.&ldquo;Those who would have graduated as doctors, engineers, accountants and teachers will no longer be in a position to enter the economy,&rdquo; he warned.
