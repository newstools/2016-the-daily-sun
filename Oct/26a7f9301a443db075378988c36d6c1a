THE last 10 years have felt like being in an oven.ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said being a leader of the governing party since 2007 has been tough.&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t take it beyond 10 years. It&rsquo;s too strenuous, it will kill me,&rdquo; Mantashe said.When asked if he would run for ANC deputy president, Mantashe said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. I won&rsquo;t be secretary-general, that much I know.&rdquo;He said there are two positions open in the top six. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s deputy president and national chairman, but no one has nominated me,&rdquo; Mantashe said.He said Cyril Ramaphosa was secretary-general before he became deputy president.Mantashe pointed at a picture from 2007 and said: &ldquo;My beard was black. Look at it now.&rdquo;He is likely to become an ordinary member after next year&rsquo;s elective conference.A faction of the ANC supports African Union chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma as president, Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza as deputy president, Free State Premier Ace Magashule as secretary-general, Jessie Duarte as deputy secretary-general and Zweli Mkhize as chairman.Mantashe&rsquo;s comments have raised suspicions that he is preparing for life outside the ANC leadership. Meanwhile, struggle hero Andrew Mlangeni has added his voice to calls for President Jacob Zuma to step down.
