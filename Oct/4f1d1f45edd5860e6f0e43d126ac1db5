THIS old soldier was caught with his pants down.And now Kebby Maphatsoe is left red-faced as a naked photo of him does the rounds.EVEN HIS 4-5 WAS CAPTURED!The pic was taken by a woman, as she lay on a bed in a luxury hotel room.The uMkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association leader lost an arm during the apartheid era, and has now lost his dignity to a girl with a cellphone.The picture has been leaked to the media.It shows the one-armed warrior naked, revealing his middle-age flab as he strips for action. He appears to be looking at a cellphone on a desk. The only part of the female companion that shows is an inadvertent selfie of her shapely, naked right thigh, in the foreground of the photo.The background shows the mapona minister&rsquo;s drooping umkhaba.This man, who has never failed to defend JZ, was attending to &ldquo;matters of national importance&rdquo; with a much younger woman in a top Cape Town hotel.So said a source from Luthuli House who asked not to be named.This political mole alleged: &ldquo;The picture started doing the rounds in political circles before it leaked to social media and nearly crushed it this week. I know I&rsquo;m not the only person who received the pictures because I heard other comrades talking about it.&rdquo;Maphatsoe shot to prominence after he claimed former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela was a CIA spy &ndash; a statement he later withdrew and apologised for.This prompted Julius Malema to mock him, saying he was a deserter who lost his arm while on the run from an MK camp.Two months ago, Maphatsoe lost a case brought by former MK and ANC member Tshidiso Mokhoanatse.The South Gauteng High Court ruled that Kebby had defamed Mokhoanatse. A few days later he lost another defamation case brought by ex-intelligence minister Ronnie Kasrils. He had to pay Kasrils R500 000 plus legal costs, and was forced to apologise to the women of Mzansi and rape survivors.In the statement he had claimed that Kasrils &nbsp;organised the rape charge against JZ by sending him the girl known as &ldquo;Khwezi&rdquo;.Maphatsoe said he has decided not comment about the issue. When asked if it was him in the picture, he said he decided rather not to comment. When asked what he was going to do, he said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not vindictive.&rdquo;He was also quoted as saying he was going to take his family for counselling.
