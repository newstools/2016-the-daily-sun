TWELVE-year-old Kgaugelo Masemola loves his steel-and-wire single bed with its thin mattress &ndash; because it saved his life!When a storm broke over his house in Zakheni, near Kwamhlanga in Mpumalanga on Saturday, Kgaugelo realised the roof was going to collapse. He needed a safe place to hide.In the room next door, Kgaugelo&rsquo;s mother, Rebone Masemola (44) was worried about the storm so she knelt down to pray.&ldquo;As I was going to check on Kgaugelo I heard a big bang and I heard him scream.&rdquo; &ldquo;I ran into the room and saw a pile of bricks on my son&rsquo;s bed. I threw the bricks off the bed but Kgaugelo was not there. I searched the entire house and then I heard faint cries coming from under the bed.&rdquo;Kgaugelo said he had been in bed but when he heard the zinc and wood bending and cracking, he crept underneath it.&ldquo;I covered my ears because the noise was so loud. Then the bricks from the roof fell down.&ldquo;The weight on the bed was too much. I thought it was going to crush me.&rdquo; Rebone said she thanks God for protecting her son. She said she applied for an RDP house eight years ago, but while all her neighbours have brick houses she still lives in a shack that she built herself.Andries Motene, the ward councillor, said Rebone&rsquo;s brother stopped her getting a house because he said he wanted to build them a big house.&ldquo;I have asked her to move back to her family house as there is a room she can live in for now.&rdquo;
