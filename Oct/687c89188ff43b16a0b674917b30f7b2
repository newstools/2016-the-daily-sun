RELATIVES of the 37 psychiatric patients who died after being moved from Esidimeni Life Hospital to community-based NGOs protested today. The protesters gathered outside the health department&rsquo;s offices in the Joburg CBD and handed over a memorandum to Gauteng MEC Qedani Mahlangu, demanding justice. The 37 victims were among 2 000 patients transferred to NGOs by the psychiatric hospital as part of cost-cutting measures. The families also demanded that Mahlangu take action to help patients who were still alive.Lerato Gova, president of Young Nurses Indaba said: &ldquo;We want government to account in court and we want the MEC of health fired.&rdquo; Cassey Chambers, operations director of the South African depression and anxiety group, said they had applied for an urgent application to stop the move from Esidimeni, but the health department had ignored it. According to Chambers, they found out in March that adults with severe mental problems had been moved to a children&rsquo;s home, putting the children in danger.Kellina Ngubene from Berea, in Joburg, told the SunTeam her brother, Bob Cindi (52) was moved and they only found him three months later in Cullinan with no food or clean clothes to wear. Christie Nxumalo said her sister, Virginia Mchapela, died after being transferred to an NGO in Cullinan called Precious Angels. According to the mortuary report, she died on 15 August but the family was only notified 10 days later. John Stephes of Section27 said they were supporting families with legal assistance. He said they wanted the SAPS to investigate.
