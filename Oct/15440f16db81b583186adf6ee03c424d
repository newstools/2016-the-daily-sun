WHEN community members heard a resident shouting for help last Thursday, they rushed to help him.The herder told them to go to a nearby bush in Jakkalsdans, northern Tshwane.When they got there, they saw six goats tied to a tree. The community members immediately knew the livestock were stolen. So they came up with a plan to catch the thugs.A group of residents decided to patrol the area, because they knew the thugs would return later that night.And just as they expected, the thieves returned in a bakkie.Charles Khumalo, a resident, said: &ldquo;We saw three men getting out of the bakkie and loading the goats into the back of the vehicle.&ldquo;When they were about to load the last goat into the van we started to run towards them. &ldquo;The criminals realised they were bust and ran for dear life. &ldquo;They were so scared they left their loot and the bakkie behind.&rdquo; Police spokesman Sergeant Kelebogile Moleko said a case of stock theft has been opened but no arrest arrests have been made yet.Mishack Matlou, an inspector at the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said he is aware of the incident. He added that the animals are with the Brits stock theft unit until the owner comes forward to claim them.&ldquo;The SPCA is concerned about the health of the animals. &ldquo;Sometimes stolen animals have kids that are only a few days old. &ldquo;When the mothers are gone, they suffer.&rdquo;Matlou urged cops to start involving his organisation in cases of stock theft.
