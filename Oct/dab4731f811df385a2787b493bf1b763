THEIR houses were allegedly built over sewerage pipes, and now the residents are paying the price.Residents of Ezakheni township, Mnambithi, KZN said the drains keep overflowing, spilling kak and raw sewage into their homes.One resident, Phindile Msimang (36), claimed her two-month-old baby died because of the sickening air when the same thing happened in 2013.Residents told Daily Sun it has been a repeated problem five years but the municipality hasn&rsquo;t done anything. The residents claimed that almost every road in the kasi is affected by sewage spills. Phindile said they have complained and reported the matter to the ward councillor and the Uthukela Municipality many times.She said they spend a lot of their time going to doctors.&ldquo;In 2013 my two-month-old baby died. &ldquo;We had a sewage spill and were forced to sleep with the smelly water inside the house because it was so bad we could not get it clean. &ldquo;I woke up to find that my baby had died during the night. She died of inhaling the sickening sewage smell,&rdquo; she said.Another affected resident Carol Khuzwayo (50) said at her house they no longer open the windows.&ldquo;The smell is unbearable. My walls and tiles have been damaged as the water also comes into the house.&rdquo;&ldquo;We need help urgently.&rdquo;Khuzwayo said they suspect the sewage system was old and needed to be repaired. Councillor Sphamandla Vilakazi said he was aware of the problem.&ldquo;I have forwarded everything to the district office who will sort it out.&rdquo;Uthukela Municipal spokesman Jabulani Mkhonza said the situation came about as houses there were illegally built over the sewer pipes. &ldquo;The sewerage pipes are blocked repeatedly with rags, plastic, stones and sometimes even cooking utensils and blankets,&rdquo; he said.
