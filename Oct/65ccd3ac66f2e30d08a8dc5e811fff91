IT&rsquo;S ATM 2, robbers 0 &ndash; but in the end community members are the ultimate losers.The only ATM at Freddy&rsquo;s Complex shopping centre near Thohoyandou was bombed on Friday night at about 11pm.It was the second attempt, after some years, to rob the cash machine, but again the thugs trying their luck had to flee empty-handed.The failed attempt however left shoppers frustrated on Saturday morning as they had nowhere to get money.Disappointed clients could be seen milling around the complex on Saturday morning as forensic specialists and the police bomb squad combed the area for evidence.Robbers had made a fruitless attempt to rob the ATM two years ago, using a tractor loader backhoe to try and break the safe.It is suspected that the robbers on Friday evening used stun grenades to try and bomb the machine.But they only managed to break the ATM&rsquo;s screen and couldn&rsquo;t reach the money.A resident who lives close to the complex said: &ldquo;We heard a big blast at about 11pm. At first we thought it was the sound of gunfire as we are used to that on weekends. &ldquo;We were surprised to see scores of cops arriving at the complex. That&rsquo;s when we learnt about the attempted ATM heist.&rdquo; She said the incident has inconvenienced hundreds of locals who depend on the machine for cash.&ldquo;The bank that supplies the ATM could now decide to withdraw their service and we will be left to suffer.&rdquo; Lieutenant-Colonel Mashudu Malelo of Thohoyandou Police Station confirmed the incident. He said a malicious damage to property case was opened but that there have been no arrests. &ldquo;We appeal to the community to come forward with information to help us crack the case.&rdquo;
