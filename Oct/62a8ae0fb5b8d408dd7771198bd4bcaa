AFTER he buried his wife in 2004 he was supposed to mourn her for six months before he could start seeing a new woman. But Andries Mothapo continued grieving for 10 years while he raised his three children alone. Now the 56-year-old from Waschbank Village in Ga-Matlala, Limpopo, has finally found love again &ndash; but his sons will not accept his girlfriend! Andries said his sons Jan (30) and Mpho (24) told him they didn&rsquo;t want him to date. Only his daughter Kgothatso (21) said she believed her father deserved happiness. He said both his sons work in Joburg and whenever they return home at the end of the month they will go to their gogo&rsquo;s house and not see him.&ldquo;It has been a long time since I buried their mum. &ldquo;I am a human too and I can&rsquo;t be alone forever. I loved my wife and grieved long enough for my soul to have healed,&rdquo; he said. Andries said before his sons found out that he had a girlfriend they had promised to extend his RDP. &ldquo;But now they don&rsquo;t want to keep their promises any more. It hurts me to see my children acting like this.&ldquo;My girlfriend does not live with me. She only visits sometimes. &ldquo;I do not know why they are so angry,&rdquo; he said. Speaking for himself and his brother, Mpho said: &ldquo;We just don&rsquo;t want him to live with his girlfriend in my mum&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;As for the extension of the house, I still need to save. My promise will only be fulfilled once he has moved out of the house with the girlfriend. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he come to me before speaking to the media?&rdquo; asked Mpho.
