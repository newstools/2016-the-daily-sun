MAMELODI Sundowns president Patrice Motsepe hopes his club s victory in the Caf Champions League will lift the country s mood following weeks of #FeesMustFall protests.Motsepe said it would go a long way in lifting the morale of the country. This is a humble contribution from Sundowns to South Africa. It was a great honour to represent the country and we are honoured to bring this trophy back home. The country had some difficult challenges concerning school fees because many students come from poor families, and this will give us few minutes to celebrate as a country, said Motsepe. He paid tribute to coach Pitso Mosimane for the achievement and said it was proof that clubs did not need foreign coaches to achieve big things. The irony is that we had coaches from all over the world but had to wait for a young man from South Africa to deliver this trophy. It shows there is so much talent in the country and we must invest in the youth. This is more about the country than me as an individual. It was an excellent performance by Pitso and the players. We didn t play too well and had to come through the back door and we must now use the front door. We can just learn from this experience going forward. We have won the league and it is for the supporters and this Champions League win is for the country. Motsepe believes five more South African clubs can win the Champions League, if they take it seriously. Once again, he reiterated that the players would share the $1,5 million prize money (about R21 million). We got into football as a humble way of giving back. I have told the players not to waste the money, they must put it somewhere where it would benefit them in future. Sundowns are also guaranteed the same amount for qualifying for the Fifa Club World Cup in Japan in December. And if they reach the semifinals, they will get even more money.
