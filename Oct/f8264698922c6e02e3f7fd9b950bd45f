WHILE other pupils prepare for the year-end exams, those at Mgandeni High School in Enembe Village in Mandeni are fighting.A grade 11 pupil, Sakhile Mthembu (20), is nursing wounds at home after he was stabbed by another pupil inside the principal&rsquo;s office on Wednesday.His madala, Makhosini Mthembu (64) told Daily Sun that he is worried that the stabbing incidents they thought the school had overcome have returned. &ldquo;I am sad that my grandson was stabbed at school. This means pupils are bringing weapons to school. &ldquo;The school needs to start searching pupils and their bags again at the gate,&rdquo; said the madala.SGB chairman Siyabonga Mbonambi told the People&rsquo;s Paper that the school was equally concerned. &ldquo;It was calm throughout the year and now pupils are starting the violence again. We&rsquo;ve experienced a similar thing over the years due to drug use and fights over girls. We even had to expel some pupils. Just when we thought we had won the battle, this happens,&rdquo; said a disappointed Mbonambi.&ldquo;We have in the meantime asked for a high level of police visibility in the school since many pupils and teachers are terrified following the incident.&ldquo;We hope this will not interfere with the exams,&rdquo; he said.KZN Department of Education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said they condemned any act of violence in the school premises.&ldquo;We will conduct a swift investigation and take necessary action in dealing with the problem,&rdquo; said Mthethwa.KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said: &ldquo;A case of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm has been opened at Sundumbili cop shop against a pupil aged 20. Two others were charged for possession of dangerous weapons,&rdquo; said Gwala.
