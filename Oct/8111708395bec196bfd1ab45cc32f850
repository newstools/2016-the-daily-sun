On Tuesday, the man was busy having arguments with himself but nobody could hear what he was saying. When asked who sent him, he said he sent himself. He was then sprinkled with muthi and asked to leave. He walked out the yard looking dizzy and nearly fell just after he walked across the street from the yard then he walked back to his house. Thandi said that she believed the man was a sangoma. &ldquo;I once told saw him at Mabopane station selling muthi. &ldquo;I think people are jealous of me. Since becoming a sangoma I always have more than 10 thwasas at a time. I am young and I don&rsquo;t have time for parties. I work with the ancestors and they are happy with that. That&rsquo;s why they bless me.&rdquo;She said she has sorted out the other sangoma. Thandi said that the man will confess and let everybody know what he wanted in her yard.
