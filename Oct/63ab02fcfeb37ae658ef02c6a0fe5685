A DEBT STORM is raging around Babes Wodumo&rsquo;s head, but Babes and her alleged creditor are calm.Rumour has it the Queen of Gqom Music and West Ink first lady owes Durban businessman and O&rsquo;Hair Salon owner, Frank Ilonde.Sunday Sun sources said &ldquo;Babes&rdquo;, real name Bongekile Simelane, owes the salon an estimated amount of R16 500.They alleged the Wololo hitmaker owes Frank money for the colourful weaves she&rsquo;s always seen wearing.But Frank said Babes owes him nothing.&ldquo;We have an understanding with Babes. She&rsquo;s been my loyal customer for two years.&ldquo;And yes, she sometimes comes in, does her hair and pays later.&ldquo;Why do people tell you that? I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Frank.The weaves Babes Wodumo allegedly owes money on are green, red and blonde, and their estimated price is R5 000 each.&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a regular at the salon and we&rsquo;ve known her for almost two years now.&ldquo;She comes in, does her hair and leaves thereafter.&ldquo;We thought there&rsquo;s an understanding between her and Frank.&ldquo;But days went by and she hasn&rsquo;t paid, and this has Frank worried.&ldquo;Every time she&rsquo;s called about her debt, she says she&rsquo;s &lsquo;too busy&rsquo;, and will settle when she finds time,&rdquo; said one source.Another source claimed the reason Babes has been unable to pay Frank was because she travels a lot.&ldquo;She&rsquo;s on the road almost every day.&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fully booked all over South Africa, and I don&rsquo;t know why people want to tarnish her name,&rdquo; said the source.&ldquo;Babes has money and I know she&rsquo;ll pay Frank. People just want to speak badly about her because she&rsquo;s doing so well.&ldquo;They must just chill,&rdquo; the source added.When called for comment, Babes told Sunday Sun: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too busy. Call me later.&rdquo;Attempts to get hold of her later were unsuccessful.
