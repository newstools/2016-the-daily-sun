MADALA Ntsizi Khota (65) hadn&rsquo;t been seen for three days, so his neighbours decided to investigate.&nbsp; But what they found will haunt them for the rest of their lives.&nbsp; Madala Ntsizi was found dead at his house in Khotsong, Bothaville in the Free State on Thursday. His 4-5, kidneys and a part of his back were missing.&nbsp; Cops believe he was mutilated by a Lesotho man who is on the loose and has since fled to Gauteng.&nbsp; His sister, Ruth Khota (54), described her brother as a peaceful man who was loved by the community.&nbsp; &ldquo;My brother was a loving man who would never harm a fly,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; She said even though he was a pensioner, he was still healthy.&nbsp; Ruth said her family was shocked by the old man&rsquo;s gruesome death.&nbsp; They believe his body parts were removed while he was still alive.&nbsp; She said the community suspects the body parts were taken to people who wanted to make muthi.&nbsp; The sister said she hoped whoever was responsible would be caught so justice could be served.&nbsp; Police spokesman Captain Stephan Thakeng confirmed the incident and said a murder case had been opened for registration.&nbsp; &ldquo;The suspect, who is believed to be a Lesotho citizen, cut off the old man&rsquo;s private parts as well as some of his internal organs,&rdquo; said Thakeng.&nbsp; He added that police have since launched a manhunt for the suspect.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anyone with information should contact Detective-Constable Tekoetsile Sepato on 073&thinsp;833&thinsp;6069.&rdquo;&nbsp;
