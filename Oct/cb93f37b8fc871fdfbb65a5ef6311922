TWO madalas &ndash; aged 63 and 76 &ndash; are to appear in court today.The two are charged with attempted murder and arson after allegedly terrorising a widow and her family.The suspects from Empiphany Village in Matatiele allegedly launched an attack on the woman&rsquo;s house on Thursday night.Trouble started for the widow&rsquo;s family in April when her husband was beaten to death. His two adult sons were arrested soon afterwards and charged with murder.By the time the sons were released on bail, the community was gatvol of the family and accused the widow of plotting with her sons to kill her husband. Sensing danger, the family fled.They returned in August but did not get a warm welcome from villagers. The bitterness towards the family labelled as killers apparently boiled over on Thursday.The widow and her sons managed to escape the blaze. One of her sons was caught by the crowd and severely assaulted. Luckily cops arrived, but by then their home was already damaged by a raging fire.Matatiele police spokesman Captain Raphael Motloung said the victims were being kept in a place of safety. He condemned members of the public for taking the law into their own hands.&ldquo;The allegations against the victimised family were being dealt with legally, but now the community has decided to break the law as well.&rdquo;
