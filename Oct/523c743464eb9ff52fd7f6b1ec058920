THE war between the DA and ANC in Nelson Mandela Bay is far from over. Tensions keep on flaring at council and public meetings. In the most recent incident, ANC regional task team member Andile Lungisa accused Nelson Mandela Bay&rsquo;s mayor, Athol Trollip, of making serious threats against him.&ldquo;While I was in hospital mayor Trollip arrived and told me, &lsquo;Kwedini Andile usezakunya&rsquo;.&ldquo;I was shocked. I never thought the mayor would insult me,&rdquo; he said.Trollip refuted Lungisa&rsquo;s claims and said: &ldquo;I only said to councillor Lungisa that he went too far today and I said that twice. &ldquo;He asked me since when did we bring firearms into the council meeting and I told him I am not investigating him.&ldquo;The ANC has disrupted every council meeting since the elections,&rdquo; said Trollip.Late on Thursday afternoon chaos erupted inside council chambers at the Woolboard Exchange Building.Blood flowed when a DA councillor was assaulted with a glass jug and a shot fired into the ceiling &ndash; apparently by a security guard &ndash; brought the fight to a halt.In the aftermath DA councillor Rano Kayser and ANC councillor Rosie Daaminds were both taken to hospital. Kayser suffered a big gash on the head while Daaminds is believed to have fainted.The fight broke out during a closed council session when issues relating to the disruption of the Integrated Development Plan meetings being conducted across the Metro were discussed. It is alleged the drama erupted moments before Trollip was to announce the appointment of new municipal manager Vuyo Mlokoti.Trollip said ANC councillors Makhi Feni and Andile Lungisa approached the Speaker&rsquo;s bench to assault the Speaker. &ldquo;A fight ensued with people hurling glasses and jugs at full force,&rdquo; he claimed. Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg said police were investigating cases of assault, intimidation and the discharging of a firearm in a municipal building.
