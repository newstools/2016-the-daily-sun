MZANSI rap star Solo is fuming in disbelief &ndash; and a bit flattered &ndash; that an overseas artist has copied his creativity.US sensation, David Brewster Jr, aka &ldquo;Dave East&rdquo;, allegedly copied &ldquo;Solo&rdquo; Langa&rsquo;s CD sleeve.Speaking to Sunday Sun Solo said: &ldquo;I started working on my album last year.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always known what the theme of my Sophomore album would be Part 2 of the Dreams trilogy.&rdquo;Sunday Sun has learnt that Solo came up with his cover concept months ago, while Dave East released his album only last month.&ldquo;My team and I sat down to conceptualise the cover, and finalised it in April this year.&ldquo;We then shot the images in May and final artwork was ready on 6 June. It was released on 10 June.&rdquo;Solo went on: &ldquo;Actually, I&rsquo;m quite flattered that a US artist has done something so similar.&ldquo;Countless times we&rsquo;ve had to deal with our artists being compared to American artists.&rdquo;Back in 2009, L&rsquo;vovo Derrango found himself in a copycat debacle, when he allegedly imitated Jay-Z&rsquo;s CD sleeve of the Blue Print.David couldn&rsquo;t be reached for comment. Sunday Sun emailed, but he hadn&rsquo;t responded by the time we went to press.
