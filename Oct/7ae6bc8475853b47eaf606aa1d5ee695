IT SEEMS the rejected Bobo has touched the hearts of men all over the country.Men have come forward to tell Daily Sun they can be better lovers than the taxi driver who ran away from her.Some are saying they will take her offer to help pay lobola, while others say she can keep her money. We will pay the lobola ourselves, they said.But the inviting Bobo Ntshong (38) is quick with a warning: I m not an easy lover and no playground for men. Bobo said she was ready to meet any of the men provided they were respectful and willing to go for an HIV test. I want men between the ages of 38 and 40, she said.She said she had a hairy body and preferred Lovers Plus and Durex condoms not Choice. I don t want someone who would want to change the way I am. She added: When I love, I love dearly! Her sad story appeared on the front page of Daily Sun on Monday.Bobo from Lusaka in Mamelodi East, Gauteng, said her boyfriend died in 2010. She was alone until August this year when she met a taxi driver 10 years younger than her.They spent the day together in his taxi, and that night they were already in love. A month later she proposed marriage to him and even offered to pay lobola. He agreed, but then disappeared.Men have been phoning Daily Sun since Monday.A man (39) from Brakpan said he likes a woman who knows what she wants. I would have accepted if she paid the lobola, he said.Another man (37) from KZN said he had been looking for someone like Bobo his whole life. We must get to know each other first. If she accepts to be mine, I promise to give her all the happiness she deserves, he said.
