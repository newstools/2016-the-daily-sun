South Africa's most eagerly-anticipated football match takes place on Saturday when Soweto giants Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs meet in a league derby at the FNB Stadium, 15H30 kick off.Chiefs are the form team going into the match, having shrugged off a poor start to the season (and end to last season) to win their last five league and cup games while going top of the table in the process.They needed penalties though, to get past Maritzburg United in the Telkom Knockout and still need to prove themselves consistently over a longer period.Pirates, fourth in the standings, are not in a dissimilar position. They are unbeaten in their last five games, but have won just two of those matches, with head coach Muhsin Ertugral himself admitting that he has not been entirely happy with Bucs' defence in particular, and their play in general.At the pre-match press conference earlier this week, both coaches promised their fans that they will endevour to play entertaining football while gunning for maximum points."It's up to us to play the kind of football you guys want to see, to make it a spectacle, not only here in South Africa, but I hear that 61 countries [will be watching], so it&rsquo;s fantastic to be world-wide," said Ertugral."We want to play attacking and attractive football while maintaining our structures and playing patterns."Likewise, Steve Komphela also hopes to see his side getting the fans off their seats while still playing winning football."We want people to enjoy the game. Entertainment in football has to be combined with results. Skills on the ball must provide value," said the Amakhosi mentor. "Soccer is not only a game, it's a culture, it's a reflection on us as society.&ldquo;What kind of people are we? We are rhythmic, play music. When we walk [it&rsquo;s like we] are listening to music, when we play it&rsquo;s the same. So when they [a player] shows that skill, to me as a South African, I don&rsquo;t have a problem."Chiefs will be missing George Maluleka through suspension, while Ramahlwe Mphahlele is back in training but unlikely to feature. Other than that Amakhosi have a clean bill of health, the likes of Simphiwe Tshabalala, Erick Mathoho and Ennocent Makhabela all available again.Ertugral meanwhile is expected to have a full fit squad available.
