SHE went to the hospital for help.But instead she came home with a bulging stomach, a huge scar and more pain!Betty Senona (35), from block R in Soshanguve, said she first felt pain in her lower abdomen in November 2014.&ldquo;It became worse and I went to Dr George Mukhari Hospital in Ga-Rankuwa, where I was operated on.&rdquo; Betty said before the operation was done, doctors allegedly told her that she would receive only four stitches.But after going under the knife she was surprised to find that she had 28 stitches!Then, two weeks after being discharged from hospital, she developed a swelling above her belly button that grew bigger every day, accompanied by an upset stomach and vomiting. Since then, she has been in and out of hospital, admitted for two to three days at a time and given pills and injections.&ldquo;The pain returns as soon as the medication wears off. I cannot do simple house chores anymore. I have become bedridden.&rdquo; Health spokesman Steve Mabona said: &ldquo;A clinical executive has made an appointment for Betty. She&rsquo;s coming to hospital today for further examination and assistance.&rdquo;
