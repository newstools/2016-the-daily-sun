THREE of Mzansi&rsquo;s soapie actors were caught in a church storm!And now Andile Sithole, from Scandal!, former Generations actor Mike Mvelase, and Isibaya&rsquo;s Siyabonga Thwala, have lost the battle.A court case has been shadowing the popular Shembe Church, also known as the Nazareth Baptist Church, for the past five years.The battle started in 2011, when church leader Vimbeni &ldquo;Uthingo&rdquo; Shembe died. His son, Mduduzi Shembe, was going to be the new church leader.But Mduduzi&rsquo;s cousin, Vela Shembe, also had his eye on the leadership. He broke away and started his own group. Mduduzi&rsquo;s faction was the Ebuhleni group and Vela&rsquo;s faction the Thembezinhle group.The three soapie actors counted themselves among the Ebuhleni group. After the two Shembe cousins battled it out in court, Judge Achmat Jappie, in the Durban High Court, finally ruled on Tuesday that Vela is indeed the church&rsquo;s rightful leader.Andile, Mike and Siyabonga now find themselves among the losing faction of the church, whose future is uncertain.Sources said the three were rooting for Mduduzi to be their leader. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen to them because according to the law, Ebuhleni now belongs to the Thembezinhle leader, Vela,&rdquo; a source said.Another source claimed the three actors are loyal to their church and follow all its rules.&ldquo;Mike and Andile don&rsquo;t shave their heads. But Siyabonga asked the church leader permission to shave his hair because of the nature of his job,&rdquo; said the source.A third source said the three regularly go to Ebuhleni to ask for blessings. And now it&rsquo;s unclear if they&rsquo;ll keep doing this.Mike refused to comment about it and hung up the phone.Vela&rsquo;s spokesperson, Nkululeko Mthethwa, said according to the church regulations, the three actors are not regarded as celebrities.&ldquo;If they come to Vela, ask for forgiveness and leave Ebuhleni, they&rsquo;ll be welcomed back with both hands,&rdquo; said Nkululeko.Neither Siyabonga nor Andile could be reached for comment.
