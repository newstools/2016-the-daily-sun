THEY are writing exams while hoping their classroom won&rsquo;t collapse on them. Tyelimhlophe Agricultural High School in Lugangeni Village, near Mount Frere, faces an uncertain future.Last Wednesday, strong winds shook the mud structure, tearing off the side of the roof. At least four pupils were hit by falling bricks but no one was injured.Teachers and pupils placed heavy pieces of wood on the roof on Friday to prevent the zinc from being blown off again. The school, which has just over 400 pupils, is housed in a mud structure built by the Wesleyan Methodist Church. Each grade is given a time for classes as there is not enough space for everyone. Principal Fikile Giwu said when the school was started the education department promised to provide temporary classrooms until a proper school was built but it never happened. He said they have classes from 6am until 8pm and many kids sleep over at nearby homes. He said he and the teachers were hired at the beginning of last year but a location wasn&rsquo;t identified for the school. They asked the church to use its building as a temporary arrangement. Pupils said they loved studying but were learning in difficult conditions. Education department spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said they would investigate and find solutions to the problem.
