WISEMAN is a very sad man!A woman who wanted to pray for him came knocking on his door and the two held prayer meetings for more than a week.And last Thursday after their prayer session, Wiseman Nxamashe (39) told the woman she could stay for the day while he went to work.But when Wiseman came back from work late that afternoon, he found the woman had cleaned out his mkhukhu at Elias Motswaledi squatter camp in Soweto.&ldquo;When I opened the door I found the shack had nothing inside,&rdquo; said shocked Wiseman.&ldquo;I trusted her because I thought she was a woman of God. &ldquo;I was convinced she was genuine because when she prayed she even cried as if she really meant it. &ldquo;But she stole from me.&rdquo; Wiseman said what saddens him the most was that he was not the only person who has suffered from the theft, but the entire community would feel it. He said: &ldquo;I run a soup kitchen and I used my stoves and refrigerator to store the food.&ldquo;My gogo died in 2014 and she was running the soup kitchen for kids, so I continued her work after her death. &ldquo;Now this woman has taken equipment which helped the soup kitchen.&rdquo; Wiseman said he fell for the holy thief and trusted her because she knew his gogo.&ldquo;I knew her because of my gogo. Anyone who knew my gogo knew she was a good person.&rdquo; Cases of theft and housebreaking have been opened at Diepkloof Police Station. Police are investigating.
