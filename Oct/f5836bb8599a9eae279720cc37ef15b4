EVEN the elders said they have never seen anything like this before.Some residents of Onverwacht, Tshwane are shocked and others believe it is a divine message from above.On Thursday, a donkey gave birth to twins.Maria Ngobeni (65) told the SunTeam she was called to witness her donkey giving birth.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to make of this,&rdquo; said Maria.Maria said the donkey has given birth four times, but this is the first time she has had twins.&ldquo;My donkey is also confused. She refuses to breastfeed the dark-haired female twin. &ldquo;I have to buy milk for the female twin because she is very weak. &ldquo;But she will survive,&rdquo; said Maria.The mother donkey is protective of the male baby donkey with the light hair. She feeds him without hesitation, but she moves away when the dark twin approaches her.Jimmy Dingane (71), a neighbour who witnessed the birth of the twins, said he grew up herding cattle but has never seen anything like this before.&ldquo;I believe God is giving us a sign of what is coming in the future, but none of us can interpret the meaning.&rdquo; Jimmy said he went around the neighbourhood asking other elders if they had seen a donkey, cow or horse giving birth to twins, but none of them had ever seen such a thing.Maria called the donkeys her children and said she would do her best to take care of both of them, particularly the dark one. &ldquo;I will wait to see what the future brings. &ldquo;I hope the birth of the twins brings me blessings, and for my family.&rdquo;
