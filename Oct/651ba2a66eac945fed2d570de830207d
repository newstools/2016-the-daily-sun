But throne occupier Irene Madela said she had tummy problems.Garatwe, from Tarlton, Mogale City said she&rsquo;s a supervisor at the farm and has to monitor that everyone does their work. &ldquo;I noticed Irene was not around and looked in vain for her.&rdquo; Then she went to relieve herself and found the toilet occupied. &ldquo;I waited for nearly 10 minutes before forcing the door open. There I found Irene inside. When I asked her why she was taking so long, she grabbed me by the neck and slapped me!&rdquo;Garatwe said she returned the favour and dished out hot klaps before pinning her colleague against the wall, bashing her head. &ldquo;She started it, but I showed her why I am the supervisor. I beat her up until she screamed for help. People separated us. &ldquo;If it were not for that, I would have left her with permanent marks. &ldquo;She has no manners.&rdquo; Irene said: &ldquo;I was shocked to see someone push open the toilet door, asking me what I was doing.
