AFTER a long battle with Parliament and the resignation of his fellow board members, SABC chairman Professor Mbulaheni Maguvhe has finally called it quits.Professor Maguvhe resigned yesterday. Maguvhe has been at the centre of the parliamentary inquiry into the board&rsquo;s fitness to hold office. He was also the last remaining non-executive board member at the SABC. A statement from the presidency read: &ldquo;President Zuma has thanked Professor Maguvhe for his services during his time at the SABC.&ldquo;The president wished Maguvhe all the best for his future endeavours.&rdquo; During the inquiry, Maguvhe failed to account for a number of controversial developments at the broadcaster, including the firing of eight journalists who questioned changes in editorial policy.He also attempted to stop the inquiry from going ahead, only to later claim he had no idea he would have to pay for the costs of the court application.However, Judge Siraj Desai ruled Maguvhe had to pay for the costs of the failed application.When responding to questions, Maguvhe said people who leaked information from the public broadcaster were not loyal. He said if it were up to him, he would fire everyone and start afresh.He previously praised former chief operations officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng for doing a good job.
