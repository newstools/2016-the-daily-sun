THE State asked that a warrant of arrest be issued for ANC NEC member Tony Yengeni after he failed to appear in the Cape Town Community Court for his drunk driving trial today.But Magistrate Andile Booi did not make a ruling on the arrest warrant and instead postponed the case to 27 January next year. Yengeni was arrested in Green Point on 12 August 2013, while apparently driving his white Maserati erratically.During brief court proceedings today, it did not emerge why Yengeni was not in the dock.It was not clear where he was.State prosecutor Dale Andrews said the defence was still waiting for transcripts relating to the police investigation and could therefore not start with further argumentsDefence attorney Sylvester Vogel agreed with this and said the transcript material had been damaged."There were scratches across the entire disk that couldn't be transcribed," Vogel told the court.The High Court will be approached to get a copy of the disk to prepare arguments in time for 27 January.Previously, in another case, Yengeni was found not guilty of drunk driving after he was arrested in Goodwood in 2007. &nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/state-asks-for-arrest-warrant-after-tony-yengeni-fails-to-appear-in-court-20161213
