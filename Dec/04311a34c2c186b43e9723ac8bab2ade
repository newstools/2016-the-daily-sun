THE smell of sewage is making it difficult for residents of NU12 in Motherwell to host guests this festive season.The residents are battling to deal with the unbearable smell of kak caused by blocked sewer drains, and they claim their municipality is in no rush to help them. According to the residents, the drains have been blocked for a month, and residents are worried about their health. Children cannot even play outside as parents fear they might get sick. Nolutho Hanisi (19), a resident, said: &ldquo;Sewage flows in front of my home and floods the yard. &ldquo;We are forced to walk through a sea of kak every day. &ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t take this long to fix the problem.&ldquo;I have reported this matter to the municipality many times, but it still has not been sorted.&rdquo;Nolutho said the awful stench makes it hard to eat. &ldquo;Can you imagine what it&rsquo;s like to eat a meal under these conditions? &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t even open our windows or sit outside. The smell gets worse on hot days, as the sewage attracts a swarm of flies. We keep our doors and windows shut to avoid the disgusting smell. &ldquo;Some people are now complaining of itching bodies.&rdquo;Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: &ldquo;We will send out a team to investigate the cause of the blockage, because we have been fixing the drains in that area. &ldquo;The team will come up with a permanent solution to the problem.&rdquo;
