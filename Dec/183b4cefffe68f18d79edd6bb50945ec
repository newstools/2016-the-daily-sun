&ldquo;OUR nation needs its father. Release our king!&rdquo;This was the cry from the Eastern Cape Contralesa Youth Wing as its members marched to East London&rsquo;s correctional services office on Friday. They demanded the release of King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo. It is almost a year since he was sentenced to 12 years in prison for crimes including arson, culpable homicide, kidnapping, defeating the ends of justice and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. According to the youth wing, African tradition says the king is the father of the nation he leads. &ldquo;Fathers, sons and households look up to their king for advice and direction. We appeal to all South Africans, specifically amaThembu people across the country and abroad, to pray for the early release of our king from prison. The leaders who run our country should be embarrassed that our king is in jail,&rdquo; the youth wing said. They handed a petition to correctional services area commissioner Mamokete Mogorosi.
