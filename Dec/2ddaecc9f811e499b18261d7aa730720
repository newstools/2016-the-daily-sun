BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic will not be pushing any panic buttons on interim coaches John Maduka and Lehlohonolo Seema after their 3-0 Absa Premiership drubbing at home by an improved Ajax Cape Town at the weekend.The coaches replaced Serame Letsoaka and have battled in their six games in charge, winning one, drawing three and losing two.Phunya Sele Sele are hovering dangerously close to the relegation zone in 13th position with 12 points from 13 games. They are only a point above bottom club Free State Stars.But the management is not about to pull the trigger just yet.Said CEO Khumbulani Konco: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll assess the situation in the new year during the recess in January. But we still have confidence in both coaches despite the bad loss to Ajax. We will not do anything drastic with only one league match left this year. The status quo remains at present.&rdquo;Konco stressed that he was not happy with the 3-0 loss at the Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium on Saturday but hoped the team could turn things around when they play Orlando Pirates in their final Premiership match of 2016 at Orlando Stadium tomorrow (7.30pm).Pirates suffered their first defeat under their interim coach Augusto Palacios when they lost 2-1 to Maritzburg United at the Harry Gwala Stadium last Tuesday.Bucs&rsquo; form has slipped in recent matches, culminating in the 2-1 loss, which left Palacios frustrated with his players.But Konco knows that a wounded Pirates will be dangerous in their backyard.Said Konco: &ldquo;Pirates are never an easy team to beat, especially when they have just lost. &ldquo;They will want to bounce back, so this will be another tough game for us. We need to get something out of this game and end the year with at least a point .&rdquo;
