WE WILL fight racism to the bitter end. These were the words of fuming KZN ANC Youth League provincial secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo yesterday, following a racist Facebook post about holiday- makers in Durban at the weekend.The post, allegedly by Ben Sasonof from Sandton, Joburg on a photo of a packed Durban beach said: &ldquo;Eh eh wena. . . must have smelt like the inside of Zuma&rsquo;s asshole.&rdquo;Sabelo said they find this comment very racist. He said they would be approaching the Equality Court to teach Sasonof that racism had no place in this country. &ldquo;On Friday, we were celebrating the Day of Reconciliation, now this happens. We want to teach this man that racism has no place in our democratic country and that it is a punishable offence,&rdquo; said Sabelo.Spokeswoman for the South African Jewish Board of Deputies, Charisse Zeifert said the board condemned Sasanof&rsquo;s offensive comment. &ldquo;The frequency with which these comments occur again highlight the need for increased awareness and education around hate crimes,&rdquo; she said.
