THE BODY was found in a pool of blood in the early hours of Christmas Day. It lay next to Khweva School in Itsani, near Thohoyandou, Limpopo. Now the family of murder victim Vhahangwele Ramaremisa (24) has more questions than answers. The grade 11 pupil at Magalangwe Secondary School went to buy Christmas supplies. According to information, he bought clothing and put the items in a schoolbag.The young man, described as very humble and a Christian, did not go straight home. He went to a church service at Shayandima.The victim&rsquo;s uncle, Langanani Ratombo, said: &ldquo;I was enjoying Christmas in Giyani when I got the bad news. I had to rush back home to face the ugly reality of death.&ldquo;We need answers as to what happened before he was killed. We think it was people who knew him and thought that he would identify them if they didn&rsquo;t kill him.&ldquo;The schoolbag with only one piece of underwear in it was brought here. What happened to the other clothing he&rsquo;d bought?&ldquo;We put everything in God&rsquo;s hands. We hope the police will work with speed and arrest those responsible for his death,&rdquo; he said.Vhulahani Ratombo, the dead man&rsquo;s aunt, said: &ldquo;A void has been left in our hearts. He was our hope for the future. We have accepted the death with sore hearts. All we need now is for the killers to be brought to book.&rdquo; Tshisahulu Sanco secretary, Tshilidzi Madega, said: &ldquo;Just last week a man in the village mercilessly killed his wife. Now we are very disturbed by the murder of this boy. In him we saw a leader but death has robbed us of that leadership.&rdquo;Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said a massive manhunt is on for Vhahangwele&rsquo;s killers. Ngoepe said the motive is still unknown. Please contact a cop station or CrimeStop on 086 001 0111 if you know anything.
