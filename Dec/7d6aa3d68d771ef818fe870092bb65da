THE beef between rappers Maraza and Jai Dee has found its way back onto the searing flames of the braai stand.And the burning smell of their now-dead friendship has become more pronounced.This after the release of Jai Dee&rsquo;s diss track titled LOL.In the song, Jai Dee real name Ernest Shabalala, allegedly pulls no punches in addressing betrayal, being used and bouncing back when &ldquo;people thought they had buried my career&rdquo;.According to sources close to the former &ldquo;best friends&rdquo;, their well-marinated beef started when Maraza discovered Jai Dee had allegedly slept with his then girlfriend.&ldquo;But they later spoke about it and forgave each other,&rdquo; a source claimed.&ldquo;Trouble started when Maraza hit the big time. He forgot the key role Jai Dee had played in his career.&rdquo;The source alleged that Jai Dee had produced and funded Maraza&rsquo;s music between 2011 and 2012.Another source claimed Maraza, real name S&rsquo;phamandla Mhlongo, was being petty for not sticking with his friend from when he had nothing.&ldquo;How can you be on good terms with someone for more than two years, and when your music career flourishes, you suddenly use a settled matter to remove them from your life?&rdquo; asked our source.Asked for comment, Jai Dee referred us to his publicist, Katleho Marumo, who said: &ldquo;The LOL single is finished and ready for release anytime now.&ldquo;We have nothing negative to say as a team and the song lyrics are relevant to what&rsquo;s happening in the music industry, especially hip hop. Our focus is to break into main stream media.&rdquo;Maraza&rsquo;s phone was on voicemail. His manager, Themba Baloyi, confirmed knowing Jai Dee briefly through Maraza.Themba said: &ldquo;Maraza has a hectic schedule, with back-to-back performances and media interviews. Our focus now is to reach the mass market and capitalising on the festive.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not pleasing to hear about the diss track, we&rsquo;ll only have a chance to listen to it in January.&rdquo;Maraza has enjoyed a successful year with his career launching on a high with his much anticipated debut album titled Blind.
