CONTROVERSIAL prophet Paseka &ldquo;Mboro&rdquo; Motsoeneng prayed for more rain yesterday. The prayer service was held at his Incredible Happenings Ministries Church in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, attended by politicians, church leaders and celebrities. These included kwaito star Brickz and actor Innocent Masuku. Mboro said it was to give thanks to God for responding to the cries for rain. &ldquo;The awesome God has honoured his word and promise when He said ask and you will be given. He has answered.&rdquo; Mboro also prayed for rain last month after Water Minister Nomvula Mokonyane advised the lack of rain will lead to drought. &ldquo;God instructed me to stand up and pray for rain. We prayed and the rain did come, even though it was storms.&rdquo;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re happy rivers and dams are almost filled and water cuts will be limited.&rdquo; He promised next year there will be no cry for water.Kwaito singer Sipho Ndlovu aka Brickz said he joined the prayer because water shortages worry him. &ldquo;I do not want to see my kids struggle for water. It is important to keep praying for rain.&rdquo; Former Generations actor Mangaliso Ngema, now a Mpumalanga dairy farmer, said Mboro brings the spirit of unity among farmers. &ldquo;The rain has brought relief,&rdquo; he said.
