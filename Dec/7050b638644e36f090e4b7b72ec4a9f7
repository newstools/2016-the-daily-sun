IN 2008 she was over the moon when she received keys to her long awaited RDP house. Today, Nokwazi Mpanza wants to pack up her bags and leave. She said it has only brought hardship for the family, especially when it rains. The 58-year-old from Siyanda, near KwaMashu, told Daily Sun she&rsquo;s lost count of the times she&rsquo;s been forced to sleep in a pool of water in the RDP.She claimed the three-roomed house could fall apart and kill her and her grandchildren. &ldquo;Every time there is heavy rain I don&rsquo;t sleep. My granddaughters and I are forced to clean out the water till sunrise.&rdquo; Nokwazi said the problem is water gathers around her RDP because of where it has been built. It ends up forming a pool and then comes through her front door. &ldquo;I have told three councillors but nothing has been done. &ldquo;I am tired of cleaning the water out of my house. I would appreciate it if the current councillor could put pipes underneath my house or find me an alternative one.&rdquo; Nokwazi said the flooding is bad for her health and the water has damaged most of her furniture.Councillor Mondli Zwane said he is trying to get someone to help her change the doors. &ldquo;I told her we can&rsquo;t put in drainage pipes because there are houses behind hers. I also cannot find her another RDP. I have suggested we change the position of her front door so the water will stop coming in,&rdquo; said Zwane.
