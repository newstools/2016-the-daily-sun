THE presidency has clarified comments that gave the impression that President Jacob Zuma had called on religious leaders to stay out of politics. On Tuesday, the presidency said Zuma had noted ongoing commentary on statements he made during the annual Twelve Apostles&rsquo; Church in Christ Thanksgiving Day in Durban earlier this month. At the time, he cautioned religious leaders to avoid getting drawn into divisive party political fights. Zuma said religious leaders should ideally strive to be above politics, and should unite people in the pursuit of justice, righteousness and the common good.The presidency said: &ldquo;It is the president&rsquo;s view that it would be helpful if religious leaders rose above the mud-slinging so they can mediate and bring about peace where the need arises. &ldquo;The president understands, appreciates and commends the role the faith-based community played in the struggle for liberation, which led to the dawn of freedom and democracy in our country.&rdquo; The presidency said the government valued the role the faith-based sector continued to play in the reconstruction and development of South Africa and in promoting national unity. Zuma has come under attack from some religious leaders during his term of office, especially those associated with the South African Council of Churches and the Save South Africa campaign.
