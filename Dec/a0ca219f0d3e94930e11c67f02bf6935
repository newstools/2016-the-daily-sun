We will not tolerate any form of behaviour that threatens the safety and well-being of health professionals and health facility support staff, who render such important work.&ldquo;In fact, the life-saving work that these people do is valuable and should never be interfered with by anybody,&rdquo; said Dhlomo.He called upon society to help protect health workers at all times. &ldquo;We also wish to express our gratitude to the security guards and SAPS for their intervention in this incident.&rdquo;Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed the incident.&ldquo;Three people were arrested for charges of common assault and malicious damage to property,&rdquo; she said.They will appear in the KwaDukuza Magistrates Court today.
