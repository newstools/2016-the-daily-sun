LOVEMORE Ngobeni has had his share of lovers, and all of them disappointed him because they just could not stick to one partner.Now he has decided to stop dating black men and try his luck with an mlungu. But he has to find one first! So he came to Daily Sun.Lovemore (21), from Acornhoek in Mpumalanga, said he believed mlungus are loyal and trustworthy, and don&rsquo;t easily chase after nyatsis.&ldquo;I dated my last guy for three years and he still cheated on me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My heart has been repeatedly broken over the years, so I think switching races might help mend it. Mlungus are generally respectful and caring in relationships. &ldquo;They understand what a serious relationship is and love whole-heartedly. For all the heartache I have experienced over the years, I need some serious loving to heal.&rdquo;Lovemore said he does not require much from a man &ndash; he just has to have respect and be caring. His ideal man should be no older than 35, must be employed or self-employed, and of course, he must be an mlungu!&ldquo;He must know that I am financially stable and independent,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I like to experience new things, and that&rsquo;s one of the reasons I decided to look for a new lover.&rdquo;
