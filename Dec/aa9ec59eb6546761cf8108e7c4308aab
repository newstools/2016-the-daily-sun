LESEGO Tsele has dedicated herself mainly to teaching young people about cultural music and good values.The 38-year-old told Daily Sun she grew up in a place where culture is taken seriously. She said when she moved to Soshanguve in Tshwane, she realised that most young people do not know anything about their culture.&ldquo;Culture has taught me respect and to avoid bad habits, but the youth of today get involved in bad things because they don&rsquo;t know their roots.&ldquo;They want to adopt modern culture, which leads them into drugs and crime,&rdquo; said Lesego.&ldquo;In 2002 I knew that I had to do something in order to change their mindset.&ldquo;That year I formed a collective called Tshwane Cultural Group, through which I teach kids, teenagers and the youth about cultural values, dance and songs.&ldquo;The group consists of 35 children aged from seven to 25.&ldquo;This keeps them off the streets and away from self- destructive tendencies.&rdquo;Lesego said the positive response she got motivated her to keep on going.&ldquo;Most parents told me that I saved their children&rsquo;s lives, because some were full-blown drug addicts unable to overcome their wayward ways.&ldquo;The parents trust me with their kids and when we have competitions out of town they pay for expenses without complaints,&rdquo; she said.Lesego said it is very important for kids to know about their respective cultures at a young age.One of her group members, Mathabo Mokoena (14), said she is glad that she joined the group because it has taught her a lot of positive things.&ldquo;Learning about my culture has taught me to respect and listen to the elders. It has also given me a chance to make friends with people who are a good influence in my life,&rdquo; she said.
