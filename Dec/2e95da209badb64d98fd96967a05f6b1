FOR many years, Johannes worked hard to make enough money to buy his family a house.But R24 000 of his hard-earned cash has gone missing from the paint can where he hid it.Devastated painter Johannes Thekiso (60) from Orange Farm, south of Joburg told Daily Sun he saved R40 000 to build a five-roomed house for his family.&ldquo;But a part-time builder has stolen my cash and never finished the job I hired him for.&ldquo;I told him to remove the one shack on the building site but to leave the other one alone because it had a paint can in it. The shack was locked but I think he got the key.&rdquo;Johannes said he paid him R7 000 in October to build the house and he spent R9 000 on building material.On 28 October he realised the remaining R24 000 was gone. &ldquo;Other workers on the site said they saw the builder with the key.&ldquo;They said they told him not to touch the shack. On Monday I went with these men and the builder to the police station and he even showed the cops the key.&rdquo;Johannes said he now sees the man walking freely on the street.&ldquo;The cops never arrested him.&ldquo;For 30 years, I worked hard painting houses and buildings and took from my pension fund to save money.&rdquo;He said when he didn&rsquo;t get an RDP, he decided to have a house built for his four kids.Johannes claims he opened a case of theft at Orange Farm Police Station. Police spokesman Captain Johannes Motsiri asked Daily Sun to send a text message with the details, and promised to investigate.
