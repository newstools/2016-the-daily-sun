Gogo Masota (67), from Moloto, near Kwamhlanga, Mpumalanga said the robbery happened on Thursday night, just hours after stokvel members had left.&ldquo;First the thugs broke the window but failed to gain entry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They then broke the main door.&rdquo;The thugs told the gogo to wake up and give them the money. She told them that there was no money in the house, but they insisted that there was. &ldquo;They told me I would never see Christmas if I didn&rsquo;t do as they said,&rdquo; said the gogo.&ldquo;I only saw that they were three of them and they were carrying a gun after they had took the light away from my face. &ldquo;I told them to take my bag and get the money, but they refused. &ldquo;They said they didn&rsquo;t want to leave their fingerprints lying around. They they forced me to give them the money and fled.&rdquo;Sergeant Zimkhona Mahlangu said a case of house robbery has been opened, and the police were investigating.
