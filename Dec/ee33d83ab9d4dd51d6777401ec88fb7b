VETERAN musician, Robbie Malinga, is at it again.And just when many thought the award-winning musician was finished, he proved them wrong &ndash; showing he only gets better with time.That&rsquo;s because Robbie and Musa Sukwene&rsquo;s love song, Mthande, has been nominated for two awards.Ukhozi FM and the SABC have each nominated the ditty in their categories for Best Song of the Year and Song of the Year, respectively.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m honoured that this work is being recognised,&rdquo; Robbie said.&ldquo;I feel blessed that our message about love is resonating very well with the people.&rdquo;Robbie said the nomination was even sweeter because Mthande was the only Afro-pop song on the list.The musician said the popularity of the song showed people were ready to fall in love again.
