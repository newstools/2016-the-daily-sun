JUBILANTE Mashele&rsquo;s son, Nhlayiso, is eight months old but she cannot get him a birth certificate. This is because Horror Affairs says Nhlayiso can&rsquo;t be Jubilante&rsquo;s son as they have her registered as a man! The 22-year-old mum from the Greater Manyeleti area in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, only discovered her ID number identifies her as male in August last year. &ldquo;I went to officials at Mhala Home Affairs to sort out the problem and they said I needed to pay R140 for a smart ID card.&ldquo;They claimed the gender problem would be sorted out when the card was issued,&rdquo; she said. Jubilante received an SMS a few weeks later to say the card was ready for collection, but when she went to fetch it, she discovered the problem had not been solved. &ldquo;The same officials at Home Affairs said I needed to pay another R140 to process another smart card. I have been waiting for it ever since then,&rdquo; she said. Jubilante&rsquo;s mum, Patricia (36) said the problem was making her daughter&rsquo;s life difficult. She couldn&rsquo;t even further her studies or look for a job.Mhala Home Affairs assistant manager, Butlers Mhlaba, said according to the system Jubilante&rsquo;s gender problem was resolved on 30 August. &ldquo;The client can currently be assisted with a gender confirmation letter. A correct new birth certificate has been issued and her smart card is being processed,&rdquo; he said.
