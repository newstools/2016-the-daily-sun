MOOIPLAAS residents are tired of waiting for promised RDP houses.On Wednesday, they gathered at the housing department in Centurion, saying they&rsquo;ve been living in shacks for 20 years and want their RDP houses.Community leader Alfred Mokiri (48) said they registered for the houses in 2005. &ldquo;We were supposed to move into our new homes last October.&rdquo; He said this year, they were told the houses supposed to be theirs are now going to be handed to Olievenhoutbosch residents in Midrand.Alfred said they struggle for survival as they&rsquo;re mostly unemployed, nor do they have running water, electricity or schools.&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to send our kids to school in town. We&rsquo;ve waited patiently for our houses but now we have had enough.&rdquo; Rebecca Mametsa (64), said they only want roofs over their heads.She said they want to spend this Christmas in their RDPs. &ldquo;We will move ourselves if the houses aren&rsquo;t given to us in two weeks&rsquo; time. We have been patient for 10 years. We will fight if that&rsquo;s what it takes for us to have proper houses.&rdquo; Housing MMC Mandla Nkomo said only 100 RDPs were built because there wasn&rsquo;t enough land for more. Over 16 000 people live in the area, which is why Olievenhoutbosch residents will be moved first.&ldquo;We want to move those residents first to build more houses and accommodate everyone.&rdquo;
