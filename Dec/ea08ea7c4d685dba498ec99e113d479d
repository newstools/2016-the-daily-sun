The home side came out firing after the break though and played some great football while also being clinical in front of goal as they scored three unanswered goals.Full ReportThe action got off to a blistering start, with chances for Lorenzo Gordinho and then Lerato Manzini in the opening five minutes.It was from an error in the Chippa defence through which Soweto side took the lead. A weak clearance by home keeper Daniel Akpeyi fell to Siphiwe Tshabalala, who kept a cool head as he strode into the box before picking his spot while Akpeyi tried to get back and defend an open goal.James Okwuosa could have put his side back in the game when he was left unmarked at a 21st minute corner, but the Chilli Boys defender planted his header wide.Opportunities continued to arrive at both ends, but Tshabalala's powerful drive was blocked by Akpeyi, while Amakhosi keeper Nhlanhla Khuzwayo was also kept busy as he palmed Tshwarelo Bereng's stinging shot away from danger.The Eastern Cape side started the second half brightly as Bereng volleyed into the side-netting before Mark van Heerden's free kick flew just over the target.Amakhosi also had their chances, but Mitchell Katsvairo lacked composure in front of goal while George Lebese was off target with a volley.Chippa finally had their breakthrough 20 minutes from time when Manzini out-jumped the Chiefs' defence to head in from Diamond Thopola's cross.And within a minute they were in the lead, as another inviting cross at the back-post was headed in by Bereng.The hosts gave themselves some breathing room six minutes from time when Manzini swept in a low shot from 15-yards out after a swift break involving several players.The victory brought to an end a run of eight games without victory for Dan Malasela's Chippa side.
