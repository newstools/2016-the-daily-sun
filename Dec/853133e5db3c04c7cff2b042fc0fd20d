THE cop didn&rsquo;t use his police bakkie for fighting crime.&nbsp; Instead, he loaded a sheep on to it for a Christmas feast!&nbsp; However, he was bust when furious kasi people told his commanding officer.&nbsp; The cop from Meqheleng, near Ficksburg in the Free State, now faces disciplinary action for using a state vehicle to transport sheep on Christmas Eve. According to residents, it wasn&rsquo;t the first time they have seen cops using state vehicles for their private business.&nbsp; A witness told Daily Sun: &ldquo;When you report a crime, the police tell you there are no cars. This is happening because they&rsquo;re out there using the vans to transport sheep!&nbsp; &ldquo;I was standing near a street corner when I saw the marked police car from Ficksburg parked where hawkers sell sheep. I was shocked when he came out with an animal and loaded it on to the bakkie.&nbsp; &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t look relaxed. He obviously knew what he was doing was wrong. This is misuse of government resources.&rdquo;&nbsp; Police spokesman Captain Phumelelo Dhlamini said: &ldquo;We are going to do an internal investigation and disciplinary measures will be taken.&rdquo;&nbsp;
