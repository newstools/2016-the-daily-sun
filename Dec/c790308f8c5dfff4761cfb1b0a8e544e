The Russian defence ministry said there was no sign of survivors at the site where a military plane travelling to Syria crashed in the Black Sea on Sunday, local news agencies reported."The site of the Tu-154 plane crash has been identified," news agencies quoted the ministry as saying, adding that four bodies had been recovered from the water. "There is no sign of survivors."A total of 85 passengers and eight crew members were on the plane when it disappeared from radars two minutes after taking off in good weather. Emergency crews found fragments about 1.5km from shore.There was no immediate word on the cause.Viktor Ozerov, head of the defence affairs committee at the upper house of Russian parliament, said the crash could have been caused by a technical malfunction or a crew error, but he believes it could not have been terrorism because the plane was operated by the military."I totally exclude" the idea of an attack bringing down the plane, he said in remarks carried by state RIA Novosti news agency.http://www.news24.com/World/News/no-sign-of-survivors-at-russian-plane-crash-site-20161225
