THE ANC believes that if Silence Mabunda had died when he was run over, nobody would even have known who the driver was .ANC regional spokesman Mandla Chauke condemned the racist and senseless attack in which Silence was run over by a bakkie, allegedly driven by Mark Scott-Crossley last Wednesday.Daily Sun reported that Silence (37), from Welverdiend in the Manyeleti area of Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, was confronted by Scott-Crossley in Kampersrus Dorpie in Hoedspruit, Limpopo. Silence claimed Scott-Crossley beat him up and only let him go when his friends begged him to stop.Silence left the scene but, according to him, Scott-Crossley followed him in his bakkie on the R36. Scott-Crossley allegedly ran him over and then reversed the bakkie over his leg before speeding off.Chauke said what makes it worse is this is the second time Scott-Crossley has been involved in human rights violations and cruelty. &ldquo;He deserves to be removed from our society and to rot in jail,&rdquo; he said.Silence&rsquo;s wife, Josephine Makhubele (32), said she will never forget the sight of her husband after he was assaulted. &ldquo;He had cuts and bruises all over his body, as if he had been attacked by vicious dogs.&rdquo; His leg is in plaster and he can&rsquo;t walk.Silence is the breadwinner for their family of five. He is a general worker at Moholoholo Wildlife Centre. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the suspect is still at large and police are searching for him.
