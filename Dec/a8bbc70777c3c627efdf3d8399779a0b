COPS are tough &ndash; but the hot sun is tougher! And the sizzling rays of the sun shone down on the passing-out parade of newly trained cops from KZN. One constable collapsed, and another four almost did the same last Thursday at Chatsworth Sports Grounds in Durban. The new cops stood under a blazing sun for an hour before signs of distress began to show. Paramedics ran up and down the ranks of young cops, looking for those who needed first aid and water. A cop source said the constables had been taught to move their toes while standing on parade, so that the blood would circulate in their feet and prevent heat stroke. &ldquo;Maybe the heat was just unbearable for them,&rdquo; said the source. However, proud parents and relatives from Ulundi, KwaNongoma and Durban packed the stadium to celebrate.Constable Sphamandla Mngoma (23), from Savannah Park in Durban, said he is proud of himself and promised to be a good cop.&ldquo;I am ready to serve my country. This is the job I was praying for while growing up,&rdquo; he said. His father, Themba Nkosi (52) said: &ldquo;My son has made me proud. Although cops get killed, I know God will protect my child.&rdquo;A total of 4 900 newly trained constables have successfully completing the eight-month basic police development learning programme.The Deputy Provincial Commissioner, Policing, Lieutenant General Fannie Masemola, said the new constables will be deployed in different areas over the festive season.&ldquo;They will be accompanied by senior cops. During their training they were taught about self protection and to protect the citizens. Masemola also warned the new constables that criminals are ruthless so they need to be prepared, adding that the safety of residents must not be compromised.
