A JEALOUS lover&rsquo;s rage over his alleged cheating girlfriend has cost another family two of their houses.This comes after a man allegedly torched their homes last week in a fit of rage because his girlfriend apparently had an affair with one of their relatives.The Motlhaolwa family from Dithakong Village in the North West said they lost everything after the man set their houses on fire. Cops have since arrested the man (33) and also found stolen property in his possession.Virginia Motlhaolwa (25) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;His girlfriend was allegedly in a relationship with a cousin. &ldquo;He came to our house, terrorised us and set our houses alight. We lost all our beds, IDs and blankets.&rdquo; North West police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said Lomanyaneng cops arrested the suspect at Setlopo Village outside Mahikeng on Saturday. Police also found a 9mm pistol with six rounds of ammunition and three cellphones that were stolen from a house in Dithakong West earlier this month.&ldquo;He is facing two cases of arson, house robbery, illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition as well as possession of suspected stolen goods,&rdquo; said Mokgwabone.He added that the suspect had been on the run from the law since November. &ldquo;He accused the two male owners of the torched RDP houses of having relationships with his girlfriend. &ldquo;The suspect has also been linked to a case of rape committed in 2013 in Mmabatho. &ldquo;He is expected to appear in the Mmabatho Magistrates Court tomorrow.&rdquo;
