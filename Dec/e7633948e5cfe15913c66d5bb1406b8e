THE sangomas in Nelson Mandela Bay are angry after being left out by mayor Athol Trollip in the re-opening of Swartkops Bridge near the M17 road.Trollip opened the old bridge on Monday in Port Elizabeth. The bridge was originally built in 1879 and it is one of the oldest in Mzansi. It was closed on 26 August for renovations. Sangomas had been crying about road accidents happening over the Swartkops bridge on M17. Chairwoman of Imbumba Yamanyange Traditional Healers Nomathongo Kosi told Daily Sun: &ldquo;The mayor made a big mistake. He was supposed to consult with us. Sangomas and traditional leaders were supposed to have slept near the river a day before the opening and performed an ukufukama ceremony. Our ancestors lived in Swartkops River and they aren&rsquo;t happy because they weren&rsquo;t consulted. What the mayor did will cause more car accidents.&ldquo;The mayor was supposed to slaughter two fat cows and brew umqombothi. Also slaughter goats and chicken to appease the ancestors. This would help in stopping the constant road accidents on the busy M17.&rdquo;Sangoma Ntombeyeza Maqwakaza said: &ldquo;The mayor speaks isiXhosa well but he doesn&rsquo;t understand our deep culture. But we can still perform the Ukungxengxeza ceremony.&rdquo;Trollip said: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t work with Sangomas because we are busy with service delivery. However, if they have a problem they should come forward. We will welcome them, anybody, even the holy men if they want to pray they must come forward.&rdquo;
