By SUNSPORT REPORTER HLOMPHO Kekana s second half goal helped Mamelodi Sundowns overcome rookies Baroka FC 1-0 in the last Absa Premiership match of the year at Polokwane s Peter Mokaba Stadium last night.Kekana headed home Anthony Laffor s terrific cross on the left flank in the 83rd minute to give their fans something to cheer about during the festive break. The Brazilians captain gave Baroka a tough time as he had earlier in the second half scored a goal that was ruled offside by referee Lwandile Mfiki.Their sixth win of the season has now moved Downs to seventh spot on the Premiership table with 19 points from nine games. The Brazilians have now narrowed the gap between them and pace setters SuperSport United to six points with five games in hand, while Baroka remain rooted to the basement on 12 points.Baroka were hoping to register their first home win of the season and also end their eight games winless streak to ease their relegation worries. The PSL rookies came into the match having won only two games, lost six and drawn the same number of matches. Baroka coach Kgoloko Thobejane made two changes to the side that drew 1-1 with Golden Arrows in their last league game. He preferred Ndivhuwo Ravhuhali and Mzwanele Mahashe in defence ahead of Theriso Mashego and Percy Nkabinde.On the other hand, the defending champions were aiming to go into the break with a win having played football non stop for the past 17 months. The Brazilians are playing catch up as they recently returned from Japan where they played in the Fifa Club World Cup. They finally gave their fans a Christmas gift having returned home without a win as they lost 2-0 to host side Kashima Antlers and 4-1 to Korea Republic outfit Jeonbuk Hyundai.
