ZAMAMBO Mkhize (31) was looking forward to welcoming the new year in with a bang. She had planned a party with her family on New Year&rsquo;s Eve after spending Christmas Day with them at their house in J section of KwaMashu, near Durban. However, on Wednesday her boyfriend, Mbongeni Malunga (33), put an end to her plans, when he apparently killed her.&nbsp; According to Zamambo&rsquo;s niece, Thandeka Mkhize (23), her aunt was excited that the year was over and had planned a get-together for the family on New Year&rsquo;s Eve.&nbsp; Thandeka said on Wednesday, her aunt had an argument with her boyfriend.&nbsp; She said: &ldquo;He came to our home and tried to break the door down, demanding to see her. She ran out and he chased her with a gun. She got to our neighbour&rsquo;s yard but Mbongeni caught up with her and shot her. He then turned the gun on himself.&rdquo; Thandeka said she was in the house at the time. &ldquo;The gunshots came from our opposite neighbour&rsquo;s yard. We rushed out to see what was happening and found Zamambo and Mbongeni lying in pools of blood,&rdquo; said shocked Thandeka.&nbsp; The family still doesn&rsquo;t know what caused the fight.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mbongeni was renting a house near ours. They have only been dating for a year and had no children. He ruined our family,&rdquo; Thandeka said. A resident said she had heard that Mbongeni had accused Zamambo of cheating. &ldquo;He was jealous, that&rsquo;s why he killed her. He should have ended things with her instead of shooting her.&rdquo;&nbsp; Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said: &ldquo;A man shot his girlfriend and himself. They were both certified dead at the scene and the motive is unknown. A case of murder and an inquest have been opened at KwaMashu Police Station for investigation.&rdquo;&nbsp;
