LAST month, Daily Sun ran an article about an abandoned school where nyaope addicts got high every morning. Residents of zone 13 in Sebokeng, the Vaal approached the SunTeam as they wanted the school demolished because the nyaope boys were causing problems in the area. Thanks to SunPower, the municipality has now broken down the walls and residents can breathe a sigh of relief!The building was abandoned in 2010 when the school was moved to the nearby RDP settlement of Boitumelo. For years, residents have been forced to watch from a distance as nyaope addicts used the building to smoke. A resident who lives near the school told the SunTeam the nyaope boys would steal from houses in the area and hide their stolen goods in the building. When the SunTeam recently went back to the area, residents said they were very happy the problem had been solved. Dipuo Malefane (30) said they were grateful their pleas were heard. &ldquo;Nyaope addicts used to come here every morning and evening but now their hideout has been demolished and we know our kids and neighbours are safe,&rdquo; she said. When the People&rsquo;s Paper first published a story about the school, Gauteng infrastructure development spokesman Theo Nkonki said the department was not aware of the building being used by drug addicts. &ldquo;The property was handed over from the education department to us in August. The department has received a request to lease the property and we are processing the application,&rdquo; he said.
