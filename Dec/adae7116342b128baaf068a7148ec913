MEMBERS of the Moretele Odi Farmers Forum became suspicious when they saw a bakkie with a trailer carrying a cow. They saw the vehicle on their way to Pienaarsrivier near Hammanskraal, in Tshwane on Monday. Junior Phofele, who&rsquo;s a farmer, said they stopped the suspicious bakkie. He said when they asked the driver where he was taking the cow, he couldn&rsquo;t answer. &ldquo;We called the SPCA and cops because it was obvious that the cow was stolen.&rdquo;He said that the driver told the cops that he bought the cow from a man only known as Mabena.The man failed to show proof that he had bought the cow. &ldquo;The cow didn&rsquo;t have a registered animal identification mark on it.&rdquo; Junior said the trailer also didn&rsquo;t appear to be roadworthy. SPCA inspector Mishack Matlou said that the cow is living at a pound for stolen stock in Murray Hill, near Rust de Winter, in Tshwane. Captain Sarah Lesabane, police spokeswoman, said that no case was opened because the owner of the cow was not there.
