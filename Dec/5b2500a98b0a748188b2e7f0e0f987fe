KWAITO artist T&rsquo;zozo has allegedly ditched his business partner, Tate Mchunu.This after their long legal battle over Umgababa New Year&rsquo;s Picnic.T&rsquo;zozo, real name Thokozani Zulu, the former group member of the now defunct Tzozo and Professor kwaito group allegedly refused to be part of the 10th Umgababa New Year&rsquo;s Picnic as he lost a court battle against Tate in February.The two formed TZZ Productions a few years back.According to Sunday Sun sources, T&rsquo;zozo won&rsquo;t be part of this year&rsquo;s event, for the first time since it was established.A source said: &ldquo;We were shocked to be told not to include his name on the posters as he told Tate he wasn&rsquo;t going to be part of this year&rsquo;s event.&ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s still bitter that the court didn&rsquo;t rule in his favour. We thought the matter between the two was put to rest, but it&rsquo;s clear they don&rsquo;t get along.&rdquo;Another source said: &ldquo;T&rsquo;zozo must apologise to Tate for using the company&rsquo;s name to make money for himself. Hence they ended up in court.&ldquo;He must swallow his pride and apologise to his partner and get back to business .&rdquo;When Tate was contacted, he said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have beef with T&rsquo;zozo. He&rsquo;s still my brother and is more than welcome to participate in the event if he wants to. We&rsquo;re still business partners, and the event goes on.&rdquo; T&rsquo;zozo said: &ldquo;My brother, all I can say is I can&rsquo;t speak about the whole matter at the moments as it&rsquo;s with the court. Please respect that.&rdquo;
