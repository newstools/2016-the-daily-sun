CHIPPA United head coach Dan &ldquo;Dance&rdquo; Malesela is hoping his side&rsquo;s sparkling 3-1 win over Kaizer Chiefs at Port Elizabeth&rsquo;s Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Saturday is the turning point for his club&rsquo;s Absa Premiership fortunes.Malesela and his opposite number at Chiefs, Steve Komphela, went into the match under pressure after a series of bad results.The win over Amakhosi was the Chilli Boys&rsquo; first in eight matches. Chiefs are without a win in six successive league fixtures and the knives are out for Komphela,The coach&rsquo;s job is on the line, with fans baying for his blood and throwing an assortment of missiles at him after the game. Komphela compounded fears that he could be gone soon by saying after the defeat: &ldquo;There is nothing I can do about it.&rdquo;But the pressure on Malesela and his players has eased after their victory over Chiefs.Malesela said: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope this will see a turnaround in our fortunes. It was a massive morale boost for the players to beat Chiefs 3-1. It has helped ease the pressure on them. I always want to protect my players from pressure. I prefer the pressure is on me. This win has been a big help in giving us a bit of relief. But we can&rsquo;t relax. &ldquo;There is still a long way to go and I want to end the year in a comfortable position in the top half of the table.&rdquo;The former Orlando Pirates star added: &ldquo;I was pleased with our second half performance where we really did well.&rdquo;But Malesela warned his players that they couldn&rsquo;t rest on their laurels. He stressed: &ldquo;It a good thing we have a break now for the Telkom Knockout final this week and our next game away to Polokwane City is only on 14 December. That will give the players time to absorb beating Chiefs so they can focus on Polokwane. &rdquo; Siphiwe Tshabala put Chiefs ahead before a brace from Lerato Manzini and a strike by Tshwarelo Bereng gave Chippa victory.
