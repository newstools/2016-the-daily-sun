SMUGGLERS loaded a donkey cart with &ldquo;duty-free&rdquo; goods and set off to cross from Limpopo into Zimbabwe. But up in the sky, a police helicopter was watching them! It happened on Wednesday afternoon, only two kilometres from the scene of the air patrol&rsquo;s success last week. In that incident, the &ldquo;eye in the sky&rdquo; cops recovered a Toyota bakkie stolen in Durban. On Wednesday, as the aircraft swooped low and landed on the river bank, the smugglers fled across the river into Zimbabwe. The donkey was left behind on the Mzansi side. It was still attached to a cart loaded with food, cool drinks and other goods regarded as luxury items in Zimbabwe. This is the second successful operation in two consecutive weeks, led by Limpopo police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, Limpopo SAPS spokesman, said: &ldquo;The origin of these items, which includes groceries, is still being investigated and no one has been arrested. We are continuing with our festive season operation that is monitored by top police management throughout the province.&rdquo;
