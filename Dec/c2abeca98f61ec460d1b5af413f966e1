Kaizer Chiefs have admitted that the club's recent run of poor form means their upcoming match against Bloemfontein Celtic has taken on extra significance.Amakhosi have not won in seven matches in all competitions and have dropped to seventh in the Premiership standings with a seven point deficit to leaders Cape Town City.The sequence of poor results has seen the pressure increase on coach Steve Komphela with some speculating he may be relieved of his duties if victory is not forthcoming against Siwelele.As such, the Naturena-based outfit have admitted that next Wednesday's encounter with Celtic is hugely significant.Chiefs issued a statement saying the outing was important because of the slump, saying: "We will be looking at this tantalising fixture to return to winning ways after experiencing a slump in recent games, losing to Chippa United away in Port Elizabeth."Meanwhile, club spokesperson Vina Maphosa highlighted the contest's relevance. He told the club's official website: "This clash is always a fan favourite - sparks are expected to fly on and off the field when the two teams meet."The tussle on the field is forever fierce and Siwelele Sa Masele with their legion of singing fan base will be met by the Gold and Black Amakhosi."
