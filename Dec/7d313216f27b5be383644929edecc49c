Then he started saying I was possessed,&rdquo; claimed Sindiswa.She said she got the shock of her life last Monday when Julia, her mum, arrived with six people who claimed they wanted to cleanse her.&ldquo;They beat me up and poured a bath full of toilet cleaner on me. They even forced me to drink some of it,&rdquo; claimed Sindiswa.Sindiswa&rsquo;s mum Julia claimed her daughter behaves strangely. &ldquo;She seems fine for a while but then she starts attacking everyone. I&rsquo;m Tsonga. In our culture, we use the liquid to chase away spirits,&rdquo; she claimed. Stepfather Enoch Tlapane said: &ldquo;I love this girl as though she were my own. We want to help her because we love her.&rdquo;Police spokesman Kay Makhubela said: &ldquo;Sindiswa has the right to open a case of assault against her parents.&rdquo;
