RESIDENTS who live near the illegal dumping site in Ga-Rankuwa View, Tshwane are shaken.This is after a foetus was found wrapped in a plastic bag on Monday morning.While Gloria Mokwape (55) was searching for empty bottles at the dumpsite, she found a plastic bag. Glorina said she goes to the site every day to look for bottles to make money and put food on the table. &ldquo;I saw a Chicken Licken plastic bag and I opened it. I hoped to find used bottles, but to my shock I saw blood. I threw the bag to the ground and called for help,&rdquo;She said a man known as Jan rushed to her and she told him what she had just discovered.Jan opened the bag and saw a dead baby.&ldquo;This is really traumatising for me as a mother and a grandmother,&rdquo; said Gloria.Jan said women take advantage because there are blocked sewers everywhere in their area.&ldquo;Just because the area has a bad smell, the woman thought she could dump the foetus at the site and no one would notice the stench.&rdquo;Patricia Mohale (50), a community health worker from a nearby clinic, said women should start taking responsibility for their actions.&ldquo;People need to start using condoms and contraceptives to prevent unwanted pregnancies, and avoid dumping babies.&rdquo; She said when they do door to door campaigns to teach the community about safe sex practices, people refuse to open their gates for them.&ldquo;They take us for granted. Sometimes they call us names. They say that we are useless. Now they can&rsquo;t take responsibility for their actions.&rdquo;Captain Matthews Nkoadi, police spokesman, said no suspect has been arrested and a case of concealment of death was opened.
