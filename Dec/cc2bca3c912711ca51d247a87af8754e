THE year will end on a bitter note for the Kodisang family. Lerato Kodisang (3) was tragically hit by a car while playing outside her house in Meadowlands, Soweto on Tuesday. She died on the scene. Her uncle, Karabo (21) said: &ldquo;Lerato was playing outside with her sister, Refiloe (6) when they suddenly disappeared. &ldquo;Just after I went outside to look for them, Refiloe came running into the house and told her mum that Lerato had been hit by a car. When we went outside we saw Lerato&rsquo;s body lying near the shop.&rdquo; Karabo said Refiloe told them they were on their way to the shop to buy sweets when it happened. A neighbour said Lerato was hit by a Mini Cooper. &ldquo;When the driver noticed the kids on the road, he tried to swerve away from them but it was too late. He hit Lerato. The residents wanted to teach the driver a lesson, but he was saved by Metro cops.&rdquo; Superintendent Edna Mamonyane of the Metro cops said: &ldquo;The crowd wanted to attack the driver but he was arrested. He was later taken to hospital for treatment.&rdquo;
