ZIMBABWEAN marksman Evans Rusike is hoping his fellow striker and current Absa Premiership leading goal scorer, Tendai Ndoro will be able inspire them in the upcoming 2017 African Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Gabon.Zimbabwe last played in the Afcon 10 years ago in Egypt and the Maritzburg United striker is positive that they will make a mark when the tournament kicks off on 14 January, despite being drawn in the &ldquo;group of death&rdquo;. &ldquo;Ndoro is on top of his game and we hope that will come in handy in the Afcon. &ldquo;We will need his goal scoring form to inspire the team,&rdquo; said Rusike of the Orlando Pirates striker who has scored 11 league goals this season. Having been drawn in Group B with Senegal, Algeria and Tunisia, three of Africa&rsquo;s power houses in football, Rusike said they were happy going there as underdogs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always good going to a tournament as an underdog. No one takes notice of you. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re hoping for. We will go there and play our game. &ldquo;We understand that we are drawn in a tough group, but we are ready. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not the ones under pressure &ndash; those three teams are as they have the top players.&rdquo;Rusike so far this season hasn&rsquo;t reached the form he showed in the last when he scored nine goals after joining the Team of Choice from Zimbabwe Saints. In 15 matches this season he has scored only one goal. He knows that his game is below par and hopes that going to the Afcon will change that. &ldquo;We last played in the tournament when I was still a schoolboy. I hope it will help me regain my form and boost me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to be part of the team .&rdquo; said Rusike. The United striker added that Zimbabwe aimed to at least reach the next round of the tournament.
