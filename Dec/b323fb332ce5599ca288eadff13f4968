LUCKY WATCHED in horror as the thug aimed straight at his 4-5 and pulled the trigger.&nbsp; Lucky closed his eyes, felt the impact . . . but heard a clang!&nbsp; HE LOOKED DOWN AND SAW THAT HIS BELT BUCKLE HAD SAVED HIS 4-5!&nbsp; Lucky Mokotedi (43), from Empilisweni squattercamp, Katlehong, Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun he was so grateful to his buckle for saving his most precious asset. He said he ran to help a resident on Sunday who was being robbed when he suddenly found himself face to face with a thug with a wild look on his face and a gun in his hand. &ldquo;The thug told me he wanted to rob me of my 4-5. When he aimed for it I knew I my life was about to change forever because my girlfriend would dump me. &ldquo;What would be the use of a man without a penis?&rdquo;&nbsp; He said he prayed hard when the thug fired.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a miracle the bullet didn&rsquo;t hit my 4-5. &ldquo;It bounced off my belt and struck my thumb. I&rsquo;m in pain now, but it&rsquo;s a lot better than life without my 4-5. I praise my ancestors for my narrow escape. I want to go home and tell my parents what happened.&rdquo; Lucky said he thought the gun only had one bullet in it. &ldquo;The thug fired one shot and ran away,&rdquo; he said. Residents went to hunt for the thug and found him hiding in a shack. He was moered and handed over to the cops. &ldquo;I want that man to face many years in jail,&rdquo; said Lucky. Community leader Peter Selepe said they have a serious crime problem in the area. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have lights and robbers take advantage of the situation. We want the municipality to electrify all the squatter camps in Ekurhuleni. Ekurhuleni Municipality says all the squatter camps will be electrified soon Winnie Mandela in Tembisa is the first squatter camp to be electrified by the municipality. A case of grievous bodily harm was opened at Thokoza Police&nbsp;Station for investigation.
