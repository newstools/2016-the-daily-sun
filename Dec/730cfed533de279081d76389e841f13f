MORE than 2 000 people marched yesterday to protest the DA-led Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality&rsquo;s decision to cut the water and electricity of kasi residents who have not paid their bills.Members of the ANC, EFF, UDM and Cope met on the Old Grahamstown Road in Port Elizabeth before proceeding to City Hall. Surprisingly, members of the DA&rsquo;s coalition partners, the UDM and Cope, criticised deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani and mayor Athol Trollip. The UDM&rsquo;s Xolile Klaas told the marchers: &ldquo;I was a DA councillor for two terms and I left the party to join the UDM. Now Bobani has gone into coalition with the DA without my approval. I didn&rsquo;t vote for the DA but for the UDM. I want my vote back from Bobani. Why are they cutting service delivery to needy people?&rdquo;Cope&rsquo;s Thembelani Kondile said: &ldquo;From the start, we never supported this coalition government but it was given to us.&rdquo; ANC regional task team convenor Vuyani Limba was smiling as he said: &ldquo;We never thought the ANC, EFF, UDM and Cope would march together.&rdquo;Mayoral spokesman Sibongile Dimbaza said: &ldquo;The mayor is not targeting the townships only. When the time arrives, the Metro cuts the connections of all defaulters.&rdquo;
