ALTHOUGH they had an early Christmas surprise from the deputy minister of transport, Sindisiwe Chikunga, the orphans believe that education is the only thing that can help them fight poverty.The campaign led by Chikunga aims to eradicate poverty in families that are headed by children.Sindisiwe Shabangu (21) is one of the people who received groceries that were given to 75 affected families at Madamu Sports Ground in Engoje Village, Vryheid on Monday.&ldquo;I am happy that we will have a good Christmas like everyone else. But our biggest problem is that we struggled to continue with school after the death of our parents in 2000. We didn&rsquo;t have money to pay school fees so we were forced to drop out and stay at home,&rdquo; said Sindisiwe.Solani Ntuli (36) said it is very hard to grow up without parents to provide for all your needs.&ldquo;Although we managed to finish our matric, we didn&rsquo;t have enough money to further our studies. We were fortunate that we went to a no-fee school where we matriculated. We really appreciate the grocery assistance, but we would like the minister to help us with bursaries or studying funds so that we could be able to fight poverty.&rdquo; Chikunga said she was glad to have had the opportunity to come out and listen to the problems that the residents face on a daily basis.&ldquo;It is true that education is one weapon that can take you out of poverty. No matter how hard the situation at home, never give up on education. &ldquo;In our department we have lots of opportunities to pay for all your higher education fees. If you really need help our door is open,&rdquo; she said.
