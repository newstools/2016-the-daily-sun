&ldquo;THIS is your clinic. Own it, protect it and don&rsquo;t allow people to vandalise it! &rdquo;These were the strong words of Mpho Phalatse, a member of the mayoral committee for health and social development in Joburg. Phalatse was speaking at the official opening of the Westbury Clinic, west of Joburg on Tuesday. The double-storey clinic, worth more than R30 million, will provide primary healthcare services to about 600 000 residents from Auckland Park, Westdene, Brixton, Richmond, Crosby and Cottesloe areas. The clinic has 18 consultation rooms. Its primary healthcare services will be mother and child health, chronic diseases, TB, mental health, social work, rehabilitation and anti-retroviral treatment. Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba officially opened the clinic. He said he respects nurses and healthcare providers. &ldquo;Nursing is an extremely challenging profession. It is often mentally exhausting, physically tiring and emotionally draining,&rdquo; said Mashaba.The mayor said a city can have the best and most modern facilities, but if it lacks the human elements of healthcare it cannot deliver on the expectations of communities.Mashaba also lashed out at drug dealers who are destroying communities. &ldquo;They are stealing our youth&rsquo;s innocence. The drug lords and gangs terrorise members of the community. We need a caring approach towards drug addicts to ensure they receive quality treatment and then reintroduce them into their communities.&rdquo; Resident Shaun Andrews (38) said the clinic will give hope to a number of people in Westbury.
