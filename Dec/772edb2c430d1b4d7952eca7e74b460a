LITTLE Evalady Chauke (3), who was swept away by a flash flood last month, was laid to rest at Waterfall Cemetery near Midrand in Gauteng yesterday.Kissmo Chauke, Evalady&rsquo;s uncle, told Daily Sun the family has been in tremendous pain. He said Shadrack, Evalady&rsquo;s father, is struggling to accept his daughter&rsquo;s death. &ldquo;He speaks about the moment the water took her from his arms. &ldquo;The fact that he couldn&rsquo;t save her torments him,&rdquo; said Kissmo.Kissmo thanked the people of Stlwetla, Alexandra and South Africa for the great support they have shown. &ldquo;We thank Gift of the Givers, who gave us temporary shelter.&ldquo;We&rsquo;d also like to thank Linda Twala, who has been at our side to give us support,&rdquo; said Kissmo.Good Samaritan Linda said he partnered with relief organisation Gift of the Givers to bury Evalady because her unemployed parents could not cover the funeral costs. Dr Imtiaz Sooliman, founder of the relief organisation, said they were happy to be able to give the child a dignified funeral.Community leader George Nxiba asked the people of Alexandra to unite in times of trouble. He thanked everyone who reached into their pockets to help the Chauke family and other flood victims.
