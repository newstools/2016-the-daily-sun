MAMELODI SUNDOWNS will face an acid test today.That&rsquo;s because the Brazilians start their campaign in the Fifa Club World Cup against home side, Kashima Antlers, in the second round match at Suita City Stadium at 7.30pm (12.30 SA time).The Caf Champions League winners will need to be mentally strong to avoid being intimidated by the host&rsquo;s vocal fans, who are expected to pack the venue and rally behind their team.The J League winner&rsquo;s fans played a vital role in inspiring their side to come back from a goal down and knockout Oceania Champions, Auckland City, from New Zealand 2-1 in their play-off round match on Thursday.But the fact that Kashima are also rookies like Downs in the competition gives coach Pitso Mosimane&rsquo;s charges confidence to beat them and progress to the semifinals, where they will meet Atletico Nacional of Colombia on Wednesday.Ironically, the Copa Libertadores Champions will also make their debut in the tournament after qualifying by virtue of being awarded a Fifa Centennial Fair Play award.The fact that Downs are already used to cold weather conditions can only work in their favour.It seems Mosimane has also done his homework, as they trained at night to ensure his players are up for the challenge.Downs assistant coach, Rhulani Mokoena, said: &ldquo;The team have settled well. We&rsquo;re looking forward to the game.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done our analysis and players have done a lot of work to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the opposition. I think we&rsquo;re ready for the challenge.&rdquo;Rhulani admitted players were jet-lagged due to the 16-hour flight from Joburg via Hong Kong.&ldquo;We cancelled our first session because the players were feeling jaded,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Based on the recommendation from our medical department, we felt it was right for players to rest and restore their bodies. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t help to work on the tactical and technical perspective, but lack the physical condition to supplement that.&rdquo;Downs&rsquo; workaholic midfielder Hlompho Kekana, winger Khama Billiat and striker Percy Tau are expected to play a key role for the Tshwane giants. Downs&rsquo; defence will have to keep a close eye on Kashima&rsquo;s Shuhei Akasaki and Mu Kanazaki, who scored the goals that plotted the exit of Auckland City.
