RESIDENTS of Ntambanana in Umfolozi Municipality, KZN couldn&rsquo;t contain their excitement when Communications Minister Faith Muthambi visited the area on Tuesday. Muthambi was in the area to spread the word about digital migration. The event also saw residents receive subsidised set-top box decoders.One of the beneficiaries, Ntombifuthi Kubheka (47), told Daily Sun that she can now enjoy watching TV, unlike before. &ldquo;The picture was fuzzy and we could only watch three channels.&rdquo;Nonhlanhla Mashiyamahle (27), who is the head of her home since her parents died, said she couldn&rsquo;t believe their luck.&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t had a TV for over a year now. This is a blessing to us.&rdquo; Muthambi said the project will open opportunities for the youth. &ldquo;I encourage the youth to take up careers in TV, journalism and other careers so that we can produce home grown content.&rdquo;She said seeing the smiles on people&rsquo;s faces is a humbling experience. Muthambi said people who are eligible for a subsidised set-top box are South African citizens with a combined income of R3 200 or less, who have a valid television licence.Muthambi added that her department is working together with the South African Post Office to distribute decoders to communities.The department said the projected total of qualifying households with functional TVs in KwaZulu-Natal is 895 738.A total of 50 475 decoder registrations have been processed until 7 December and 23 443 installations have been completed.
