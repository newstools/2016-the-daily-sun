WHEN the thug sneaked into the house and stole Joyce Sibiya&rsquo;s wallet, DVD player and electric kettle, he also stole her son Sibusiso Themba&rsquo;s life. Joyce&rsquo;s wallet, stolen in 2009, had her son&rsquo;s birth certificate inside.Now, Themba cannot apply for an ID, because someone else has already been issued with the document.His mother Joyce (48) said: &ldquo;I opened a case the following day and also wrote an affidavit about the stolen birth certificate.&rdquo;In 2014, Sibusiso (19) of Sibayeni near Malelane in Mpumalanga began applying for an ID. That was the beginning of his problems. &ldquo;I could not believe that someone was walking around, calling himself Sibusiso Themba. &ldquo;I went to five different Home Affairs offices, and was told the same thing. I asked to see the picture of my bogus self, but they refused.&rdquo; Sibusiso said he cannot study further, apply for a job, or even open a bank account.His biggest fear is that the person could be a thug who goes around killing, robbing and raping in his name.Joyce said they provided Home Affairs with a case number of the charge they opened with the police and an affidavit shortly after the robbery. Home Affairs&rsquo; Thabo Mokgola said the department has instituted an investigation into this matter. &ldquo;Our officials will contact Sibusiso to resolve the matter.&rdquo;
