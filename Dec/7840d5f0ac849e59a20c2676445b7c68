VICTOR Mngomezulu is tired of seeing his late wife cry about the tombstone on her grave.The 63-year-old from Diepkloof, in Soweto, told Daily Sun his wife, Elizabeth, died in 2010 but still visits him in his dreams. &ldquo;She tells me that the stone on her grave is too heavy on her and she needs a stone with her details.&ldquo;She says it is the wrong tombstone and she wants it removed,&rdquo; said Victor.When he went to clean Elizabeth&rsquo;s grave he was shocked to find a huge tombstone on his wife&rsquo;s grave with the details of a different person. &ldquo;I asked the officials and they admitted the stone was erected on the wrong grave,&rdquo; he said. Victor said the officials told him that they have tried but failed to trace the people who erected the stone.&ldquo;I have bought my own stone for Elizabeth but I have nowhere to erect it.&rdquo; Victor also can&rsquo;t do rituals on her grave.&ldquo;It hurts me. It&rsquo;s as if I&rsquo;m failing my wife,&rdquo; he said.Joburg City Parks spokeswoman Jenny Moodley said the City made contact with Victor and has secured all the relevant information to speed up the process.&ldquo;The challenge is trying to locate the family whose headstone is on the grave. The grave has the same number as a different grave in a different section of Avalon Cemetery.&rdquo;
