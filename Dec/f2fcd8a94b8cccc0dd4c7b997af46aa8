THEY were feared hardcore criminals who used to commit armed robberies.But the two ex-convicts have turned over a new leaf in life.Today they are making an honest living.Lyle Smith (39) and Oupa Ndaba (40) have opened a food place called Leswikeng Pavement Restaurant, which opened in April.After they were convicted of armed robbery, Lyle was sentenced to 18 years while Oupa was serving 20 years at Zonderwater Maximum Prison in Cullinan, Pretoria..They were both released in 2011 and this year, they decided to open the restaurant in Mamelodi West, Tshwane.&ldquo;It was not easy to find a suitable spot for the business. But then, we identified a dumpsite and converted it into a hot selling spot,&rdquo; said Lyle.The pair has no experience of working in the food industry but their business is doing well. &ldquo;We are so proud of ourselves. Customers are attracted to the place because it is neat and clean.&rdquo; They cook mogodu, cow heels and heads, chicken wings and pap. Lyle urged other ex-cons to change their ways and become better individuals. Oupa said having a manager on their side has helped them a lot because he instils discipline.Manager Justice Nchabeleng said: &ldquo;They have completely changed and their business has a bright future. We appeal to community members to keep on supporting them.&rdquo;
