SIPHAMANDLA&rsquo;S dream of becoming a teacher and making a lot of money to help his dad may never happen.Siphamandla Tembe (17) was swept away by strong waves at Jabula Beach in St Lucia, Mtubatuba, northern KZN during a family outing on Tuesday.The ongoing search for the boy has not been successful and his family are losing hope that he is still alive.Siphamandla&rsquo;s dad, Zakhe Tembe (49) from KwaMsane, Mtubatuba, said his son drowned before finding out he&rsquo;d passed grade 11. &ldquo;He was going to be in matric in 2017. I have no hope my son is still alive,&rdquo; he said.This sad dad was called to the beach by family members who were with Siphamandla. &ldquo;I have made peace that he is dead by now. I saw sharks in the sea where he went missing. I&rsquo;m praying we will find his body, or at least part of it,&rdquo; said Tembe.Tembe added his son worked hard preparing for his exams. &ldquo;But now he won&rsquo;t see the fruit of his hard work. &ldquo;He always told me one day he will do big things for me in thanks for not abandoning them after their mother died in 2013.&rdquo;This dad and son spent most of their time together.&ldquo;He always told me one day he will grow up and be a man like me who loves his kids.&rdquo;Siphamandla&rsquo;s brother Qiniso Tembe (22) said they were in the sea together when his brother disappeared.&ldquo;This is still fresh and so traumatising, I can&rsquo;t talk about it,&rdquo; he cried.KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed the 17-year-old boy is still missing.&ldquo;The Empangeni Search and Rescue Team and the Air Wing Team from Durban are searching from Durban towards Sodwana Beach,&rdquo; said Mbhele.
