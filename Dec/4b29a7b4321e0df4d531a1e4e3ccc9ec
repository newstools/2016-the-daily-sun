IN AUGUST, Lekau Magagane&rsquo;s son was found dead. Puleng&rsquo;s body was found lying on the street in Seshego zone 1, Limpopo. The body had two wounds &ndash; one in the neck and the other in the chest.&ldquo;I was called to rush to the scene and when I arrived there, the police told me they had gathered enough evidence to make arrests,&rdquo; said Lekau. Two suspects were later bust, but they are currently out on R1 000 bail each. Lekau said the murder case is not being treated properly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this because for starters, I have been receiving endless calls from the suspects&rsquo; parents, asking me to accept their apology,&rdquo; said Lekau.He told Daily Sun that he has no problem accepting the suspects&rsquo; apology, but wants justice for his son&rsquo;s death. &ldquo;Even before we buried my son, the suspects&rsquo; parents sent a pastor to my house with R1 000 to ask for forgiveness,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;They must stop calling me. Let the law take its cause. I don&rsquo;t want to interfere with the case. &ldquo;I can see they want me to forgive them and withdraw the case.But what about my son? Will that bring him back?&rdquo; Seshego police spokesman Warrant Officer Mothemane Malefo said: &ldquo;Only the state has the power to withdraw the case, based on the outcome of the investigations. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d like to assure the family of the dead man that the case will be dealt with in terms of the correct procedure.Malefo confirmed that the suspects are out on R1 000 bail each, and said they were expected to appear in the Seshego Magistrates Court this week.
