BIDVEST Wits head coach Gavin Hunt is a happy man!Hunt was delighted that his Clever Boys bounced back after four winless matches by defeating Free State Stars 3-1 to move to second in the Absa Premiership table with 24 points. They are now a point behind leaders Cape Town City with two games in hand.But what pleased Hunt even more was the return of his teenage striker Phakamani Mahlambi, who was out with a hamstring injury for nine months.But the Students mentor is not getting carried away: &ldquo;There is still a long, long way to go.&rdquo;Mahlambi, one of Mzansi&rsquo;s brightest talents, showed what local soccer fans and Hunt were missing when he scored a brace on his return, including a confident penalty.Said Hunt: &ldquo;Mahlambi is a shining light. We really missed him. He is a tremendous talent and brave. He was not supposed to take the penalty but he took the kick and scored. &ldquo;I have no problem with that. I&rsquo;m thrilled he is back. His form was brilliant.&rdquo;Mahlambi was injured in a league match against University of Pretoria in February and many believed it could have been career-threatening. But with the help of his brother Mthobisi, the brave 19-year-old fought back. Mahlambi underlined his potential by deservedly winning the Man of the Match award, which he presented to his brother. Mthobisi had donated his own hamstring to allow his sibling to continue his soccer career.Meanwhile Hunt, who has always struggled against Ea La Koto, said they were better than their bottom-of-the-log position showed: &ldquo;We have gone four games without a win and are happy we broke that sequence. It was a good win against a good side. They are too good to go down.&rdquo;Hunt is gearing up for another tough battler when his side travel to the Harry Gwala Stadium tomorrow for their final league match of the year against Maritzburg United (7.30pm)Said Hunt &ldquo;Maritzburg are the most improved side in the league. We aim to finish 2016 on a high.&rdquo;
