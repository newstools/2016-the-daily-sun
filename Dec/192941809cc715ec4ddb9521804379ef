AT LOCKDOWN the cops counted eight prisoners before slamming shut the iron bars.On Saturday morning, however, only three were left in the holding cell. But the escaped prisoners&rsquo; freedom was shortlived. Four of the five were rearrested on Monday. One prisoner, Tshireledzo Makhadzi (26), is still at large.Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the prisoners escaped from Acornhoek cop shop&rsquo;s holding cells on Friday night. Hlathi said: &ldquo;Katekani Lubisi (25), Lloyd Mashaba (28) and Prosperity Moeng (31) were rearrested in Tsuvulani Village, Limpopo. Sabatha Maboi (24) was caught in Masoyi, outside Hazyview. The prisoners said they were on their way to Zimbabwe.&rdquo;Hlathi said the four will soon appear before the Acornhoek and Bushbuckridge magistrates courts to face their initial charges of assault, theft, rape, possession of an unlicensed firearm and business robbery. They will also face an additional charge of escaping from lawful custody.Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Makhadzi should contact Lieutenant-Colonel Hanyani Mushwana on 082 469 1298.
