BEWARE! Fake cops are on the prowl!This is an urgent warning from KZN cops to residents of Durban and surrounding areas following complaints by victims of a scam since the beginning of the festive season. The cops said the imposters target people carrying large sums of money.Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, KZN cops spokeswoman, said the fake cops in full police uniform approach their victims in the knowledge that they are carrying a large amount of money. &ldquo;They then claim that a bank had been robbed of the same amount of money the victim is carrying. They pretend to arrest them while really robbing them of their money.&rdquo; Mbhele said a few similar cases have been opened around Durban. &ldquo;The SAPS is investigating this concerning matter.&rdquo;She said people should transfer large amounts of cash into the accounts of the people they need to pay. Mbhele urged victims to take down as many details as they can about the fake cops if confronted by them. &ldquo;The SAPS appeals to the residents to be vigilant and to phone 10111 or their nearest police station if they see the group.&rdquo;
