DEPUTY president Cyril Ramaphosa said South Africa can no longer have a situation where the resources continue to be owned by one racial group.&ldquo;It is intolerable that white people continue to hold senior positions in workplaces and control the economic pie. &ldquo;We need to speed up the transformation of our economy, land reform and the management of our economy.&rdquo;Answering questions in parliament yesterday, he spent most of the time defending the proposed minimum wage.He said it was a step in the right direction to uplift over seven million workers with low wages.He said it is a challenge to the unions when negotiating salaries to ensure workers get over the minimum wage. &ldquo;I urge you to embrace the national minimum wage. Don&rsquo;t kick against it because of your personal ideology. This should be seen as a launching pad to deal with poverty and inequality.&rdquo; Ramaphosa said the panel tasked with coming up with the figure considered many factors, including the low economic growth, as well as the global economy.Figures such as the proposed R12 500 were looked at but it was concluded that they would result in job losses.&ldquo;We are already looking at measures to prevent job losses which may occur as a result of the introduction of the national minimum wage.&rdquo;When asked why ANC MPs voted against the motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma, he said it was the nature of democracy.&ldquo;The opposition must not cry foul when their views do not find expression.&rdquo;
