WHEN the bus left Joburg Park Station for the Eastern Cape on Wednesday evening, excited passengers were eager to get home at the designated time.But their journey turned out to be a long and frustrating one. The City To City bus broke down in Pietermaritzburg, KZN Midlands.On Thursday the fuming passengers were forced to sit outside the bus and bake in the scorching sun for hours while waiting for help to arrive. Angry passenger Ntobeko Ngcungca (20) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Gogos, madalas and small kids were crying because they were hungry. We were stuck there from 4am and the driver told us that he had contacted the owners who promised to send another bus immediately.&ldquo;But we sat there for more than 12 hours!&rdquo; Another passenger, Nokuthula Sigcawu (18) said they were angry because they paid a lot of money for the bus fare. &ldquo;The bus was carrying 60 passengers and each ticket cost R410. That means the bus owners got R24 600 for this trip and yet they do not even service their buses. This is not fair and it shows that they do not care about out safety,&rdquo; said Nokuthula.She said the second bus arrived at 8pm on Thursday evening.&ldquo;We got home 12 hours late.&rdquo;Transport department spokesman Ishmael Mnisi said: &ldquo;The condition of all public transport should be prioritised to ensure the safety and security of our the passengers. &ldquo;Our law enforcement agencies will be out in numbers to check if all vehicles are roadworthy.&rdquo;Kgomotso Masilela from City To City told Daily Sun she was not allowed to speak to the media. She said the company&rsquo;s spokeswoman, Ingrid Ramalekana, was out of the office and there was no number available on which to reach her.
