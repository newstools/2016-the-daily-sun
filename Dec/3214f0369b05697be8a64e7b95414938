WHEN the lifeless bodies of two children who had gone missing three weeks earlier were found in a stream, sangoma Malesela Magowa (39) and two of his colleagues were arrested. The police soon released them as they were not linked to the killings. Instead, cops arrested the father of one of the murdered boys! But despite this shocking development, sangoma Malesela still cannot return to his village because residents have allegedly vowed to kill him. Malesela told Daily Sun that he hasn&rsquo;t gone home to Thokgwaneng Village outside Polokwane since his release last weekend. He said angry family members of the boys &ndash;&ensp;Petrus Shoka (7) and Samuel Ngobeni (10) &ndash;&ensp;along with community members, arrived at his house at 3am in the morning the day after the boys were reported lost, accusing him of knowing their whereabouts. &ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for the cops who arrived there just in time they would have killed me.&rdquo; He said he feared residents would attack him and kill him as they believed he&rsquo;d used human body parts for muthi.&ldquo;Because of this I&rsquo;ve been labelled a bad person who practises traditional healing with human blood. I know that the angry mob was led by other sangomas who always complain that I&rsquo;m taking clients from them. They are jealous of me because they know that traditional healing is in my blood. It&rsquo;s not the kind where you go to school and learn. I&rsquo;m led by my ancestors.&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t use humans to heal the sick. I go straight to the bush and dig up traditional herbs for muthi.&rdquo; Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe, Limpopo police spokesman, said Samuel&rsquo;s father, Madimetsa Chuene (37), has since been arrested and charged with murder. He appeared in the Polokwane Magistrates Court. Another suspect was arrested this past week. Both men will appear again in court on 26 January.
