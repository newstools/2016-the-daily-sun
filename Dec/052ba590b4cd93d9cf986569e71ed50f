ACCORDING to a number of SunReaders, the Forensic Pathology Services in Gauteng have been on strike for a week.However, Gauteng Health Department spokesman Steve Mabona said the department got a court interdict against the strikers on Saturday.The health department confirmed to Daily Sun that workers downed their tools last Thursday, but forensic officers returned to work this week. Employees told the SunTeam they were striking because although their jobs traumatised them, they also felt that they were not appreciated. &ldquo;We see bodies every day. We feel we deserve to be paid decently for the hard and traumatising work we do,&rdquo; said an employee. Several people have phoned the People&rsquo;s Paper over the last week to complain. Maki Ngomane (47) from Kaalfontein in Midrand, Gauteng, said: &ldquo;Last Wednesday we suddenly lost our brother. We suspect he died of food poisoning but we need a post mortem to confirm it. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t bury him until it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo; She said the family went to Forensic Pathology Services in Germiston, Ekurhuleni, on Monday only to be told nothing could be done until the strike was over. &ldquo;We asked to see our brother in the mortuary and we were shocked by the state he was in. &ldquo;His body was rotting and you could hardly recognise him.&rdquo; Sonto Mkhonza (49) from Wadeville in Ekurhuleni said her family had to postpone her gogo&rsquo;s funeral which was due to take place this weekend. Faith Sondlo (47) from Molapo in Soweto said her family had the same experience with her nephew&rsquo;s body. Sources in the mortuaries told the SunTeam bodies had been piling up since the workers went on strike. Mabona said post mortems on outstanding cases had been fast tracked and the department had been interacting with workers to solve their issues.
