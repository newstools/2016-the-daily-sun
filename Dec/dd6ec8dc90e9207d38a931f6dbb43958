She then told me the baby had died weeks after she gave birth,&rdquo; said gogo.&ldquo;When we asked why she hadn&rsquo;t said anything, she claimed the government had buried the baby.&rdquo;But the gogo kept having bad dreams and she went to the hospital.She discovered that the baby hadn&rsquo;t died. &ldquo;I was told that my daughter left the hospital with the baby, accompanied by a man and a woman.&rdquo; When the gogo confronted her daughter, she allegedly admitted she was desperate for money and had sold the baby. The People&rsquo;s Paper contacted the daughter.She said that she was old enough to make her own decisions.&ldquo;My mother must stop worrying about what I do. I did not sell the child, I gave her up for adoption,&rdquo; she said.
