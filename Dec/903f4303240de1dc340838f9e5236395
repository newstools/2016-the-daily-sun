LIFE continued as normal on Wednesday for the little ones who go to KwaDabeka C&rsquo;s park 100m away from the Umgeni River, as they took turns riding on the merry-go-round.But the adults in the neighbourhood were worried by the discovery of a man&rsquo;s decomposing body on Tuesday in the thick bush near the shores of the river.Mechanic Sbonakaliso Xulu (36) told Daily Sun he was working in his garage when a group of local hunters came knocking on his door.&ldquo;They usually come to ask for fuel to heal their dogs&rsquo; wounds when they hunt in the nearby bush. &ldquo;But on Tuesday they looked frightened. When I asked them why, they answered that they had come across a man&rsquo;s body hanging from a tree.&rdquo; Sbonakaliso said he and other residents were concerned that their children had unknowingly spent time near the decomposing corpse.&ldquo;We grew up being told that kids shouldn&rsquo;t come near the dead. &ldquo;Besides, this corpse was the third to be found near the park in a year. The body of another dead man in his mid-30s was found hidden in the long grass at the end of last year. &ldquo;Early this year, a woman&rsquo;s remains were found. This is really worrying. None of the dead people were from this area.&rdquo; Another resident, Jabula Mntungwa (41), said the body found recently was hanging by a rope from the branch of a tree.&ldquo;His face was severely decomposed and we couldn&rsquo;t tell who he was. Nobody seemed to know him.&ldquo;But he was still wearing his clothes. I can&rsquo;t tell whether he was killed and hung there or whether he committed suicide. &ldquo;Hopefully, cops&rsquo; investigations will reveal the circumstances behind his death,&rdquo; Jabula said KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said an inquest docket was opened at KwaDabeka Police Station.&ldquo;The dead man is unknown and an investigation is still in progress.&rdquo;
