DURING former SABC board member Professor Bongani Khumalo&rsquo;s time on the board from September 2013 to January 2015, poor business decisions were made.Khumalo made this statement at Parliament&rsquo;s ad hoc inquiry into the SABC board yesterday.He said he received a letter from Communications Minister Faith Muthambi in 2014 asking him to give reasons why she should not recommend President Zuma remove him from the board.This was after he had publicly disagreed with the board&rsquo;s decision to name Hlaudi Motsoeneng as permanent chief operating officer in July that year. After failing to get hold of the minister, Muthambi&rsquo;s legal adviser, Dan Mantsha, told Khumalo the letter was not meant for him.Despite the reassurances, Muthambi never withdrew the letter after Khumalo requested her to do so, which ledto his resignation last January.What made it stranger, he said, was that Muthambi previously pleaded with him to help stabilise the SABC.Khumalo also said some of the board&rsquo;s functions were impacted by the interference of ministers.The former board member said the issues at the public broadcaster was possibly common to all State-owned businesses. &ndash; NEWS24
