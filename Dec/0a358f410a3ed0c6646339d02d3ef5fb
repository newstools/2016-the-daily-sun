ANC comrades on the Lower South Coast are worried about the dark cloud that seems to be haunting their leaders.This comes after newly elected Ugu Municipal mayor and ANC regional chairman, Tolomane Mnyayiza, died after a long illness at a hospital in Margate on Wednesday.This comes barely a month after the killing of Ward 3 Councillor Ace Houston and Councillor Thembinkosi Zoleka, and Ward 1 candidate Councillor Bongani Sikhosana died in August. ANC regional spokesman Sipho Dlamalala said the death of Mnyayiza is a heavy blow to the region. &ldquo;This year alone we have lost four of our leaders. Even though Mnyayiza is believed to have died of natural causes, the death of one of our own is painful,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;He was a unifier who wanted only peace among his comrades and employees. &ldquo;He was in office for only four months but it would be easy to think he had been there for years.&rdquo;Dlamalala said arrangements for his memorial service and funeral will be announced as soon as they meet the family.ANC provincial spokesman Mdumiseni Ntuli said Mnyayiza refused to be corrupted or intimidated.&ldquo;He fought for the people. The movement has lost such a great servant.&rdquo;
