I&rsquo;ve heard rumours of a so called petition being signed by pastors who have a problem with me.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going anywhere.&rdquo; The congregation continued to listen to their pastor while angry residents of Butterworth and Primrose protested, saying they had asked the municipality to chase the church away long before it made headlines on Thursday.This after paramedics were called in to treat about 20 congregants who became sick after the pastor gave them a pink drink.Tshepo Machaea, public safety MMC at King Sabata Dalindyebo Municipality, said the church was violating a number of by-laws.&ldquo;There is no application by this church at our office.&rdquo;Reverend Zolisa Mqamelo, OR Tambo Ministers Fraternal chairman, said they wouldn&rsquo;t allow Topi to abuse the name of their Lord in their town.&ldquo;We will deal with him.&rdquo;
