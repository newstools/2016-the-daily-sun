IT IS business as usual for under-pressure Platinum Stars as they take on rampant Cape Town City in the Absa Premiership at Athlone Stadium tonight (7.30pm).Dikwena have been in a downward spiral since losing to Bidvest Wits early in November and have now lost four matches in a row. They are third from the bottom in the league standings, with only nine points from 11 matches. Stars coach, Cavin Johnson, is hoping their luck will change when they face the newly crowned Telkom Knockout champions tonight. Said Johnson: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always pressure in football. When you&rsquo;re up, you are expected to stay there and when you&rsquo;re down, you have pressure to move up. People always ask what the management says when things go like this. My manager is a football person, he understands there are times when teams are not in a good space &ndash; they come out of it.&rdquo;Johnson is hopeful his charges will turn things around before the Christmas break. He said he was looking to move up the ladder and collect as many points as possible from their remaining three matches this year. After CT City, Dikwena host Maritzburg United at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium on Saturday and end 2016 away to Highlands Park on 20 December.The former SuperSport United mentor knows it won&rsquo;t be easy getting maximum points from CT City, who are still on a high from their cup final victory at the weekend.&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t been in a good space but we are prepared to go to the champions. We need to get through this. We aren&rsquo;t bad travellers, which could work to our favour, but we have to be careful. They are at the top of the table and just won the Telkom Knockout. I hope luck will finally be on our side,&rdquo; he said. Johnson added that they would need to fight to get out of their recent slump.
