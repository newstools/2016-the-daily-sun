Six of the arrested iingcibi were from OR Tambo district, one was from Buffalo City and two from Lady Frere. Traditional affairs spokesman Mamnkeli Ngam has appealed to parents and community members to come forward to report illegal schools.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already had 24 initiates dying in the Eastern Cape. Chris Hani has the most deaths followed by the OR Tambo and Alfred Nzo districts. We will work hard to ensure those responsible are brought to book.&rdquo; Provincial health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said 36 initiates had been hospitalised in the province, but no amputations had been reported. ) Meanwhile in the Western Cape, the health and cultural affairs departments said initiation schools found to be unsafe could be closed down. However, ingcibi Sikela Zokufa said it was also the responsibility of parents to make sure boys come home safe. Over the past month, four initiates have died in the province.Zokufa said: &ldquo;One initiate died after he ate poisoned food from home. Some parents send their kids to the bush and never check on them.&rdquo;
