Parliament speaker Baleka Mbethe was officially accepted as Makoti by the Khomo Family today at Bochabela in Mangaung. Baleka got married to&nbsp;Bloemfon&shy;tein businessman Nape Khomo (57), in a traditional ceremony in Mqanduli, Eastern Cape in September.&nbsp;The wedding was actually meant to take place in Joburg but was moved to Mqanduli at Baleka&rsquo;s family home and where her parents are buried. It is said that&nbsp;Nape insisted on paying lobola in cows rather than cash.
