Then I start cleaning the streets.&rdquo; He said on weekends he wakes up at 3am.&ldquo;People drink a lot over weekends and throw bottles everywhere. I make sure that they see clean roads when they get up in the morning.&rdquo;He said his job keeps him active and strong.&ldquo;This is my secret for a longer life.
