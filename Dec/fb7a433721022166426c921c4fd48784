THE mourners had gathered to pay their last respects to the deceased at the cemetery.But the dead were not going anywhere.That is because their grave was filled with water!What was meant to be a solemn Saturday morning at Vanderbijlpark Cemetery turned out to be a stressful moment for dozens of families as they tried to remove the water from the grave with buckets.Meanwhile scores of relatives and supporters stood in the scorching sun.Families said they arrived at the cemetery in the Vaal, south of Joburg, to find the graves waterlogged.Mourners and the families speculated about where the water had come from, as it had not rained in the area over the past few days.Other witnesses noted the water appeared to be coming from underground.A spokesman for one of the affected families, Lehlohonolo Seremo, told Daily Sun they saw the water-filled grave as they were removing the body of their relative from the hearse.&ldquo;People who came to support our family had to stand aside as we tried to remove the water with buckets.&ldquo;But we could not win as water kept on rising from the ground. &ldquo;In the end we were directed to a different grave allocated by the municipality,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We are deeply disturbed by this. No one is supposed to witness such a thing, especially on the day of their funeral,&rdquo; he said.Maki Hanyane from MT Funerals said they reported the matter to the municipality but seemed to be speaking to walls.&ldquo;This problem has been dragging on for a while now,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;We reported the matter to the municipality, but no one seems to care.&ldquo;It is not rain water. It rises from the ground.&ldquo;We have to deal with this matter almost every weekend,&rdquo; she said.Another owner of a funeral parlour in the area, Motsumi Phale, said the watery graves were disrupting funeral businesses as people distrusted them.Efforts by the SunTeam to get comment from Emfuleni Local Municipality drew a blank as their spokespeople were not available for comment.
