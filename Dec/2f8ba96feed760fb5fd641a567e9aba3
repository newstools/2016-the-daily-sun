Coach Giovanni Solinas was forced to make an early tactical change as he opted for Nyiko Mobbie in space of Charles Kampi.However, Solinas&rsquo; changes didn&rsquo;t assist his side as such, as Sundowns broke the ice through Billiat. It was a beautiful combination between Dolly and Castro, who later lay it out for the Zimbabwean striker to finish.Their lead was short lived as Stars launched a counter attack immediately to get an equalizing goal through Thokozani Sekotlong stunning curler to beat Dennis Onyango on the top left of his goal post.When it looked like Ea lla Koto was starting to get back into the game and shock the home side with another goal, it was Sundowns that got back their lead after another great display of football by Tebogo Langerman, who crossed the ball on the left to find Percy Tau alone inside the box and finished it off with his head.Billiat and Castro were in the picture again just two minutes after they scored their second goal and Dolly scored the third goal for Sundowns before Tau registered his brace in the last 10 minutes of the game to give Sundowns a comfortable 4-1 win.The Brazilians will stay at position eight with 16 points from 8 games.
