GOGOS and mkhulus from Chiawelo in Soweto received early Christmas presents on Saturday.About 66 elderly people were given solar lights, and it is all thanks to the Vuka Development Centre and Nedbank.These lights use the power of the sun. This means that the lucky elders will not be using their pension money to pay high electricity bills.Lerato Baxter, centre manager at Vuka, said they are trying to ease the burden on old people.&ldquo;These pensioners cannot be seen paying too much for electricity,&rdquo; Baxter told Daily Sun.&ldquo;They must enjoy the little that they get on other things.&ldquo;Lights sometimes consume a lot of electricity and that is why we are trying to bridge that gap.&rdquo; Gogo Paulinah Nchache (72) said the solar lights will make a huge difference in her house. &ldquo;We are so happy that people are thinking of us and what we are going through,&rdquo; she told the People&rsquo;s Paper.Another gogo, Hesiah Chikude (66), told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Electricity is so expensive these days, and we don&rsquo;t know what is going on. &ldquo;These lights will help us a lot.&ldquo;Thank you to everyone who donated the lights. It shows that they really care about us.&rdquo;
