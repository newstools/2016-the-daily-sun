NEWLY elected EFF councillor for the Jozini Municipality in KZN, Sphamandla Myeni, is a hunted man. The 23-year-old claims members of opposition parties are out to kill him. The councillor claims that he&rsquo;s been terrorised by SMSes since the beginning of the month. The threats apparently say that he will be killed in broad daylight! Myeni, from Mkhuze, said he wouldn&rsquo;t be intimidated.&ldquo;I will not go into hiding or step down from my position. I am here to serve the people and bring change to my community. If by doing that I have wronged someone and deserve to be crucified, so be it,&rdquo; he said.Myeni said the threatening messages come from a number he does not know.&ldquo;The sender tells me that I will not finish my term as a councillor. The messages say I will be killed in broad daylight and that my whereabouts are always known. When I call the sender, the number goes straight to voicemail,&rdquo; said Myeni.He said he knew the issue was politically related.&ldquo;Many people are not happy with me representing the EFF in the municipality. There have been many attempts to have me expelled from my position. In August, a woman close to me confessed there were people convincing her to get me arrested. They wanted her to seduce me and later lay a charge of rape. That plan did not work and now they want to get rid of me permanently.&rdquo;KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said: &ldquo;A case of intimidation has been opened at Mkhuze Police Station for investigation. The complainant alleged that he received messages from an unknown number threatening to kill him.&rdquo; When Daily Sun contacted the message sender&rsquo;s number which was provided, it also went straight to voicemail.
