Ajax Cape Town playmaker Bantu Mzwakali says Mark Mayambela and Thabo Mosadi have played a big part in the club's revival of form in recent weeks.After going nine league matches without a win, the Cape side have climbed out of the relegation zone with three consecutive victories over Platinum Stars, Mamelodi Sundowns and Golden Arrows.Mzwakali believes that Mayambela and Mosadi have played a significant part in the upswing of fortunes."I think it was a good idea to bring the guys to the club. They brought a different dimension to the team and everyone can see it," Mzwakali was quoted saying on the club website."They have pace, trickery, good vision and can push the team to play. We do understand them and you can see we have changed now."They are good communicators and when things are not going well, we talk and see where we can rectify."Mzwakali also paid tribute to the work done by new coach Stanley Menzo."On the other hand, the coach is also someone who worked with our minds and the results are there. I am happy to be an Ajax player once again."However, the mission is to remain disciplined for us to keep winning our games &ndash; that's very important now as we head to the Christmas break."
