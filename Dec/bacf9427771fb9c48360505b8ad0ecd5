The woman&rsquo;s angry gogo told Daily Sun she is happy her daughter has been arrested.&ldquo;My daughter was evil to dump her son. &ldquo;I will hate her forever,&rdquo; said the gogo.She said her daughter lied to her about the baby.&ldquo;One day she took me to a creche claiming she left the baby there but as we were going into the creche, she ran away from me.&ldquo;The creche didn&rsquo;t know anything about the baby. &ldquo;She made a fool out of me for a long time,&rdquo; said the gogo.She said when she heard the baby was alive, she wanted to bring him home.&ldquo;All I want is to have my grandson home.&rdquo; Social worker Thandazile Zulu from Joburg Child Welfare said the gogo will have access to the child. &ldquo;It is a process to have the child taken back to the parents but the case is with the court.&ldquo; It will probably grant the biological family the chance to take the child home.&rdquo;Zulu said the gogo might even get her grandson as early as March next year.Sandringham police spokesman Captain Mohlaume Mamaboro confirmed that police are investigating a case of child neglect.He said the suspect was arrested and is in custody.
