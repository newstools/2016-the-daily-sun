THERE will be a baby boom in September next year! That&rsquo;s according to KZN Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, who says the children will be the result of festive season sex. Dhlomo has warned the province&rsquo;s young women not to become victims. He urged them to abstain from sex or use condoms. He revealed that figures collected between 2013 and 2015 showed that the province&rsquo;s hospitals recorded more babies born in September than in any other month.&ldquo;This means most mothers conceived their pregnancies during the December holidays.&rdquo; Dhlomo expressed concern that of the one million babies born countrywide each year, 8% of them are delivered to teenage mothers.&ldquo;It is no secret that during the school holidays and the festive season many young people may be tempted to experiment with new and dangerous things. &ldquo;This includes substance and alcohol abuse and unprotected sex, which may have long-term effects on their lives.&rdquo; Dhlomo&rsquo;s final word to young people caught up in the excitement of the holidays was: &ldquo;Pause and consider the consequences of your actions. Do not allow temporary fun during the holidays to disturb your progress in life.&ldquo;If you have unprotected sex now, you&rsquo;ll be a mother in September. &ldquo;You might even contract a sexually transmitted infection or HIV.&rdquo;
