ANGRY hawkers shut down the Tshwane fruit and vegetables market last week.They then marched to the City of Tshwane offices in the CBD to deliver a memorandum to mayor Solly Msimanga.Hawkers complained that the mayor was taking their children back to poverty. They claimed that former mayor Kgosientso Ramokgopa had approved a bursary fund for the hawkers&rsquo; kids in Tshwane.Hawker Mary Ngema said they had told Ramokgopa that they were tired of seeing their children working with them in the streets after finishing their matric. &ldquo;We asked Ramokgopa to help us send our kids to school so that they don&rsquo;t end up like us, and he agreed to assist,&rdquo; said Mary. She said they were worried after Msimanga told them that the city won&rsquo;t continue giving bursaries to their children. Ntsiki Mokhotho, member of mayoral committee for sport and culture, accepted the memorandum.&ldquo;I will make sure that the memorandum reaches the relevant people, and that the matter is attended to as soon as possible,&rdquo; said Mokhotho.
