IT&rsquo;S hardly a month since Noma Khumalo was crowned Idols SA winner.But her newly-released album is making noise for all the wrong reasons.Sunday Sun can reveal that Noma&rsquo;s debut album, Joy, which was released on Monday, is the talk of town for the breach of copyright laws.This after it emerged the album title and main song were allegedly stolen.Sunday Sun understands Noma was to title the album Joy, after the title of the lead song.But Leconelle Music wrote to Gallo Records to stop the release &ndash; claiming the song belongs to their artist, Disebo Mhlangu.Fundile Mdingi of Leconelle Music said: &ldquo;We have a great working relationship with Gallo Records.&ldquo;What we did was to make a formal request not to have her album released until the matter is resolved.&rdquo;He added: &ldquo;Disebo wrote the song in 2012. She took it, together with other tracks, to a guy named Pablo. But he went behind her back to Samro and registered the song as his own.&rdquo;Producer Leclere &ldquo;Pablo&rdquo; Serumule refused to comment, and said: &ldquo;I have no comment.&rdquo;Disebo said she was shocked to hear the song on iTunes but credited to Noma.&ldquo;Lyrics, the melody and everything are all mine. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if an Idols winner does a cover version of my song as long as I&rsquo;m credited and paid royalties for it,&rdquo; Disebo said.She said she even considered to drop the song from her album because hers was coming last.&ldquo;But my producer refused, saying I should fight for it &ndash; because I&rsquo;ve been working on it for the past five years,&rdquo; she said.Both Gallo Records and Noma could not be reached for comment.
