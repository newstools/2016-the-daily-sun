ELIZABETH Dandara (28) normally sleeps until the sun is high, but yesterday morning she woke up very early. The woman from KwaNobuhle kasi, Uitenhage said she was up early to wash her family&rsquo;s clothes. She had barely left her bed when a speeding jikeleza taxi crashed through the bedroom wall!Elizabeth believes that waking up early in the morning saved her life. Unfortunately, all her family&rsquo;s Christmas food and furniture was damaged. She said the taxi crashed into her house at about 5.45am, causing the wall to collapse on the spot where she had been sleeping. &ldquo;I normally sleep late, but yesterday I was restless, so I got out of bed and started to do my washing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;About 15 minutes after I had left my house, I heard my neighbours screaming, some calling my name. &ldquo;I was confused and didn&rsquo;t know what was happening. I then heard a big crash as the wall fell and my house was covered in dust. &ldquo;I saw an Opel Corsa at rest in my house.&ldquo;I immediately screamed for my two kids and my sister, but they were fortunately asleep in another room.&ldquo;The wall that separated my bedroom and the lounge had collapsed.&rdquo;She thanked God for saving her life. &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t gone outside I would be dead now. I had saved R2 500 with my stokvel for Christmas food, but now it&rsquo;s all gone down the drain.&ldquo;The driver promised to repair the damages. He claims his brakes failed.&rdquo;
