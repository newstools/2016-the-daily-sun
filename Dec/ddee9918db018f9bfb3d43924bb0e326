RESIDENTS of this rural area were full of joy at the weekend.This was after a new outdoor gym was officially opened in the Msholozi area of Umbumbulu. The gym was opened by KZN Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo.He urged residents to help lower the burden of disease in the province by eating well and exercising regularly. &ldquo;The adoption of healthy lifestyles is the only solution to halting the prevalence of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, high blood pressure and some cancers, which have reached epidemic proportions,&rdquo; said Dhlomo.The gym, which was sponsored by the South African Sugar Association, has exercise and body-building equipment, as well as a children&rsquo;s play area. &ldquo;A healthy lifestyle is a way of living that lowers the risk of being seriously ill or dying early. Not all diseases are preventable, but a large number of deaths, especially those from coronary heart disease and lung cancer, can be avoided,&rdquo; said the MEC. &ldquo;Health is not just about avoiding disease. It is also about physical, mental and social wellbeing. When a healthy lifestyle is adopted, a more positive role model is provided for other people in the family, especially children.&rdquo; Dhlomo urged the residents to be aware of risk factors such as smoking, drinking, taking drugs, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity and stress.Sipho Ngcobo (32) told Daily Sun that he was grateful to the sponsors for putting residents first. &ldquo;This is the first real gym in our area. I&rsquo;ll definitely use it to keep my body strong. I love weight-lifting, and I used to do it with home-made dumbbells and barbells,&rdquo; said Sipho.
