S O IT was my birthday on Friday, spent with family and friends, reflecting on the changes we want to see in 2017. What most women don&rsquo;t want is anal sex, so stop asking them to be &ldquo;adventurous&rdquo;. I always tell women to suggest the man tries it first, so they can back off.It&rsquo;s been a crazy year, I know it&rsquo;s the silly season, but people seem deranged. I heard of a domestic worker who faked her death. Another called her boss claiming she had been swept away by a flash flood &ndash; a whole month after the floods!But 2016 must end! Because it&rsquo;s been insane. I was recently hailed on the highway by a man. I slowed down, hoping I could help him, and this man, who wore a wedding ring, asked for my number.Sies. Do I look like AA? Like I could tow a guy? Don&rsquo;t answer.We need a return to normality, after we&rsquo;ve put the silly season of 2016 behind us.We need change: Stop your married husband from cheating byensuring he&rsquo;snever alone these holidays. When he drives &ldquo;quickly, to get the papers&rdquo;, send a child along to keep him company. Here are my tips for a return to normality &ndash; which is unlikely! Avoid sleeping with other people&rsquo;s men in 2017, as you could get caught &ndash; by his wife or an STD.) No still means exactly that in 2017: NO!) Racism will no longer be tolerated and I hope we are all going to Hout Bay for Christmas.) If your abused friend makes excuses for her man who &ldquo;kicks her where people can&rsquo;t see&rdquo;, please tell her to leave &ndash; or unfriend her, to avoid another funeral.) Keep hoping MP Lumka Yengeni will drop those heavy brows and liberate her fashion sense.) Don&rsquo;t host yellow bone parties which cause lowself-esteem and bleaching in dark girls.) There&rsquo;s no need to be broke in January, if you&rsquo;ve been saving monthly for the things you must have.) Be a little selfish with your black tax payments.) Remember &ndash; once a blessee, always a blessee. Look at their mums. It&rsquo;s hereditary.) The rich should have their teeth fixed. Because it&rsquo;s so alarming to watch them drive German and wear Italian &ndash; with some teeth missing from the grin.) Guys &ndash; watch out for the women who frequent clubs just to spike your drink, and then go home with you simply because they want to rob you.) Don&rsquo;t flaunt a man whom you might be sharing with another lady. It&rsquo;s gonna be crazier.All that would be nice. But to be brutally frank, what I predict for 2017 is lots more of 2016!
