She&rsquo;s the type of woman who hates airing her affairs in public.&ldquo;So she asked Bongz not to invite the media because she wanted ilobolo and the traditional wedding to be for friends and family members only.&rdquo;Although most of the artists were allegedly not invited, another mole said some of Mabala Noise artists and management were there &ndash; including Kay Sibiya, Communications Manager Mhlo Gumede, Bob Dube and Flabba Rimoscow.This source said Bongz wants to change his life and believes having a wife will protect him.&ldquo;Women love to throw themselves at DJs and other popular artists.
