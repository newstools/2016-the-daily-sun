BORUSSIA Dortmund set a new Champions League scoring record in their 2-2 draw with Real Madrid on Wednesday, while FC Porto and Sevilla claimed the two remaining last 16 spots.Dortmund made sure of top spot in Group F after fighting back from 2-0 down against defending champions Madrid, leaving the Spanish giants with theoretically a tougher draw to make the quarterfinals.Marco Reus was the star of the late show at the Santiago Bernabeu, hitting the equaliser two minutes from time.A double from Karim Benzema looked to have Real well set to leapfrog the Germans and secure a home game in the second leg of their last 16 tie.However, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang reduced the arrears before substitute Reus slid in to turn Aubameyang s dangerous low cross high into the net.Dortmund scored 21 goals in their group campaign, the most for any team in a group stage in the history of the tournament. Real had some big chances in the second half but we hoped for a lucky punch and we got it, said Reus. Auba was world class with his pass and I was happy to get on the end of it the goal was 99% him and 1% from me. Sevilla made the last 16 for the first time in seven years after soaking up the pressure to draw 0-0 away to Lyon in Group H.Table-topping Juventus defeated Dinamo Zagreb 2-0, with Gonzalo Higuain and Daniele Rugani on target.Leicester City, who had already made sure of top spot in Group G in their debut season in the competition, suffered their first loss of the campaign, 5-0 at Porto who went through as runners-up. It was the biggest Champions League defeat for an English club.Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri, with one eye on his side s faltering defence of their Premier League title, made 10 changes from the team defeated at Sunderland last weekend.Tottenham Hotspur, meanwhile, came back from a goal down to defeat CSKA Moscow 3-1 and claim a Europa League place.Alan Dzagoev put the Russians ahead after 33 minutes, but the lead lasted just five minutes before Dele Alli levelled from a Christian Eriksen cross to ensure that CSKA goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev s miserable Champions League record of failing to keep a clean sheet stretches to 39 games.Harry Kane and an Akinfeev own goal gave Spurs the three points.England star Kane admitted that Tottenham would need to improve their home form if they are to progress in future European adventures. You are playing the best teams in Europe, so you can t rely on away results, which we have done this season, said Kane.The draw takes place on Monday. AFP
