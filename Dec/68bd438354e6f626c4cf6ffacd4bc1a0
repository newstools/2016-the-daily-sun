THE South African police are warning Hillbrow revellers that they will be out in full force on New Year&rsquo;s Eve! The men and women in blue are preparing for the usual rowdy crowds on the streets of Hillbrow, Joburg when every year, party-&nbsp; goers throw things off their balconies, including fridges, beds and television sets.&nbsp; But cops warn that things are going to be different this year, as they will make sure that law and order is maintained in Gauteng. Yesterday, with other law enforcement agencies, police said they will be organising all resources available to take strong action against illegal activities traditionally associated with New Year celebrations.&nbsp; Police spokesman Lungelo Dlamini said these activities include violence, abuse of the 10111 centre, traffic violations, drunken driving, public drinking, malicious damage to property, breaking municipal by-laws, domestic violence due to alcohol abuse, drug trafficking and illegal sales of booze.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will have more undercover cops to identify those involved in illegal activities like drug dealing,&rdquo; said Dlamini. He added that road rage, domestic violence, child neglect and malicious damage to property due to boozing were common at this time.&nbsp; He said illegal street closures associated with street bashes and illegal car racing broke municipal by-laws. &ldquo;Police will effect immediate arrests if these take place.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cops appealed to residents celebrating at home to make sure gates and doors are locked.&nbsp; Tips for those who will be visiting taverns include: -&thinsp;Not accepting drinks from strangers as they may be spiked or laced with intoxicating substances. -&thinsp;Women not walking alone, especially at night, to avoid becoming victims of sexual assault.&nbsp;
