ANOTHER ANC councillor has been gunned down in KZN.Mbhekiseni Khumalo (56) from KwaLubisi Village, in Uphongolo Municipality, northern KZN, was gunned down at his house on Saturday. His killers had posed as residents wanting help from him as a community leader. When he opened his door, the men opened fire. Khumalo&rsquo;s killing comes hardly three weeks after ANC Councillor Ace Houston from Umuziwabantu Municipality in Harding, southern KZN was gunned down.KZN provincial secretary Super Zuma said they were concerned that killers who murdered councillors were still walking about freely.&ldquo;The continuous killing of public representatives has the potential to create instability and to make other councillors unable to perform their duties to service communities. &ldquo;However we have not lost hope that our law enforcement will bring these killers to book,&rdquo; said Zuma. He urged residents with information to help the police so that those who masterminded the killing of councillors could be arrested.Mxolisi Kaunda, MEC for transport, community safety and liaison, said it was high time that a loud and clear message was sent to those who kill councillors.&ldquo;I have directed the police to do everything in their power to bring to justice those responsible for this heartless deed,&rdquo; said Kaunda.Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said Khumalo was shot four times in the chest and was taken to hospital, but died of his injuries.
