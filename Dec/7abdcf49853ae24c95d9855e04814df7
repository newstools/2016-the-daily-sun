We are so shocked by Sfiso s death. We were in the process of finishing the clothes we made for him and his wife, said Agnes. Sfiso was a loving and generous person. He was a good Samaritan who came to us at a time when we really needed the food. There was nothing to eat at the centre, she said.Syphra Rangani, one of the elderly women who live at the centre, said she was struggling to come to terms with the musician s death. I m so shocked. I can t believe he is no longer with us, she said. She remembered Sfiso s kindness and said he bought cereal for them. He told us gogos must also have a decent breakfast. AENS
