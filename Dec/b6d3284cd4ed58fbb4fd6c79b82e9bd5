PUBLIC SYMPATHY for axed Bafana Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba is hard to find.&nbsp; While Safa made sure they played it according to the book, the fans are just happy to see him go.&nbsp; MOSTLY, THEY SHAKE THEIR HEADS AND SAY, GONE, BABY, GONE!&nbsp; Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba was finally dismissed yesterday.&nbsp; He was charged with misconduct and for bringing the South African Football Association into disrepute. Safa CEO Dennis Mumble stressed there will be no golden handshake for Mashaba, who was reported to be earning about R500&thinsp;000 a month.&nbsp; The straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back was during the qualifier for the 2018 World Cup against Senegal in Polokwane last month.&nbsp; Despite Bafana winning 2-1 against all odds, a highly upset Mashaba went on a rant against Safa president Danny Jordaan, Mumble and the media at the post-match proceedings.&nbsp; He was subsequently suspended and formally charged.&nbsp; &ldquo;We went through all the proper disciplinary channels. We got an independent chairman, Advocate TT Serero, to oversee the entire process,&rdquo; said Mumble. &ldquo;The chairperson finally delivered the verdict and we were left with no other option.&nbsp; &ldquo;They were all dismissable offences and he was found guilty of all the charges.&rdquo; Mumble added that even though Mashaba apologised to the national executive for his conduct, he still came to the DC showing no remorse.&nbsp; &ldquo;He still believed his actions could be justified and that he was in the right.&nbsp; &ldquo;Serero thought the coach didn&rsquo;t show remorse and that&rsquo;s why he gave us those recommendations.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mumble was cagey when asked about a new coach. He said they have no one in mind yet and will look everywhere.&nbsp; &ldquo;The next step is to engage the technical committee to advise the executive committee of the process for replacing the coach.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have to get a new coach in about a month&rsquo;s time because we have Afcon/CHAN qualifiers in March.&rdquo;&nbsp; In their search for Mashaba&rsquo;s replacement, Safa will cast their net wide, focusing on a coach with a lot of experience on the African continent.&nbsp; Owen da Gama and Thabo Senong, the assistants Mashaba brought with him when he took the job in 2014, are on tenterhooks. Their future is in the balance.&nbsp; Mumble said: &ldquo;As for Da Gama and Senong, they will remain employed by Safa and the new coach will recommend whether they stay or not.&rdquo;&nbsp; The names of Roger de Sa and Carlos Queiroz have been mentioned. Jordaan is a big admirer of Queiroz, who is currently contracted to the national team of Iran.&nbsp; De Sa could be Queiroz&rsquo;s assistant.&nbsp; They were both born in Mozambique and have been close friends for many years.&nbsp; They also worked together with the national team of Portugal at the 2010 World Cup in Mzansi. Attempts to reach Mashaba for comment were unsuccessful as his cellphone was on voicemail.&nbsp;
