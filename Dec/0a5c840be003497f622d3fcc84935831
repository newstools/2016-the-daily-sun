A MAN didn&rsquo;t want to be arrested for public drinking.So he shot himself and died just to stay out of trouble! It happened on Tuesday at Eerste Fabrieke in Tshwane after four boozers were cornered under a tree by members of the Metro police.According to the department&rsquo;s spokesman, Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba, the four drinkers fled but cops managed to nab three of them.Residents helped the cops to close in on the fourth man, who was armed. The officers then called for back-up. When the man saw he had nowhere to run, he pulled a gun and opened fire on the cops. After firing four shots, he put a fifth bullet through his own head! He died instantly.Mahamba said it was impossible to know why the man took his own life.He told Daily Sun no one else was injured and an inquest docket was opened. The dead man&rsquo;s friends appeared in court yesterday on charges of drinking in public and were released on a warning.
