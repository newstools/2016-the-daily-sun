PRAY for my mum! Pray for Thandi!This was the plea from Thandi Klaasen&rsquo;s daughter, Lorraine, as the frail jazz singer lies in hospital after having suffered a stroke.An emotional Lorraine told Daily Sun her mum was very ill and that the beloved singer had lost her voice.&ldquo;She suffered a stroke last year but recovered and her health was improving,&rdquo; said Lorraine. &ldquo;But then recently she suffered another attack. We&rsquo;re awaiting the results of several scans and examinations to determine what caused the stroke this time.&rdquo; Thandi was admitted to hospital on 9 December.&ldquo;She is severely ill and can&rsquo;t speak,&rdquo; said Lorraine, adding that it pains her to see her mum lying in bed, unable to talk.&ldquo;It is very sad and painful to see her like this.&rdquo; Thandi was born in 1931 and grew up in Sophiatown. When she was a teenager, her face was permanently scarred when a mixture of thinners and petroleum was thrown at her. Her career as a singer and dancer began in the mid-50s.In 1961, she moved to London to work in the musical King Kong.She has performed with Dolly Rathebe, Miriam Makeba, Dorothy Masuka and many others.Lorraine said she was grateful for the support and love she had been receiving from her mum&rsquo;s fans since she was admitted.&ldquo;It is astonishing how many people loved my mother.&ldquo;Every day we get messages of support on Facebook and wishes for her speedy recovery,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;We plead with all South Africans to pray for my mother.&rdquo; Naledi Senye, founder of the Women of Destiny Club, added her voice to the call for prayers for Thandi.&ldquo;Thandi is a very strong woman. She inspired countless individuals all over the world.&ldquo;We know she&rsquo;ll make it.&rdquo;
