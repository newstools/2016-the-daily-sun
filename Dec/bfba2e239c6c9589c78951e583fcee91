CONTROVERSIAL SABC acting Corporate Affairs head Hlaudi Motsoeneng spoke at an ANCYL lecture in Durban on Thursday night.He covered a range of items during his lecture on economic freedom: from recent political speed bumps in the ruling party, to job creation. Here are five of the best Hlaudisms from his address: - "I am a born intellectual."- "Too much education is dangerous. Don&rsquo;t overdose on education. I talk to professors and I like them. I ask them why they are always quoting people and telling us about the world, but why can&rsquo;t you come with solutions. Until you come with solutions, I will not recognise you."- "I go to interviews for fun, not because I want a job. I tell the panel that their questions are not relevant, so I tell them that I can assist them and tell them what questions to ask. And then I get the job."- "You know why we are not moving with speed in South Africa, because we have copied the West. We are in Africa; we should have our own standard. When you do research, it takes three years, and two years to implement them. I don&rsquo;t believe in research. It is not how I operate&hellip; if I see a problem, I solve it now.&rdquo;- "There is a difference between a certificated person and an educated person, but I won&rsquo;t go there."&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/head-in-the-hlauds-5-pearls-of-wisdom-from-motsoeneng-20161202&nbsp;
