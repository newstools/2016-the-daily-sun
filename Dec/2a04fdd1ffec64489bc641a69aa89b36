THE load on the Quantum minibus headed out of Mzansi on Sunday was twice as big as the taxi.When Metro cops stopped the taxi on the N12 near Emalahleni, Mpumalanga, the goods on the trailer measured 3,5 metres. The load included 10 bar fridges, 14 microwaves, window frames, beds, sacks of mealie-meal and bags of onions.The driver, Ali Thobela from Tshwane, who was on his way to Maputo in Mozambique, was fined R500.His taxi was impounded and he was told to reduce the number of goods he was carrying before he could continue his journey.Ali said his passengers are forced to buy goods in South Africa.&ldquo;For instance, mealie-meal is very expensive on the other side of the border. &ldquo;It is much cheaper for people to buy it here,&rdquo; he said.The taximan said he often transports goods outside the country, and foreigners pay him a fee depending on the weight of the load. He said the trip takes two days and they have to stop often to rest. &ldquo;I sometimes sleep in the taxi when I reach the border before continuing the trip the following day.&rdquo;A passenger in the taxi said life was difficult for everyone in his home country.&ldquo;South Africans are truly blessed.&rdquo; On Saturday, Transport Minister Dipuo Peters launched a festive road safety campaign on the N12 near Eldorado Park, south of Joburg.
