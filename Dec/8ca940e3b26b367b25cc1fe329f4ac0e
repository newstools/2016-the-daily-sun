GOSPEL giant Sfiso Ncwane had a lavish funeral. But trouble was brewing among the mourners . . .THE FAMILY FROZE OUT HIS OWN SISTER! It happened yesterday at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal (KZN).Sfiso&rsquo;s sister, Gugu Ncwane, was forced to sit among strangers, while a few family members huddled with celebs.According to Gugu, there were only &ldquo;certain&rdquo; people allowed to sit with Sfiso&rsquo;s widow, Ayanda. These were her kids, her mother-in-law Fikile &ndash; and VIPs: celebrities and government officials. Angry and isolated, Gugu and other family members had been cut out of the elite group. So they left, got themselves food, then stood waiting outside the stadium until the end of the proceedings.That was where the broken-hearted Gugu spoke to the SunTeam. &ldquo;We went to the airport to receive Sfiso&rsquo;s body, along with Ayanda. But when we arrived at Moses Mabhida, marshals told us we weren&rsquo;t allowed to sit with Ayanda,&rdquo; Gugu said. &ldquo;Even when we explained that we were close family members, they insisted we should sit with the general public.&rdquo; She said the marshals refused to reveal who had instructed them to keep her out. So Gugu, her uncle and cousins sat with the general public until they could not take it anymore &ndash; and walked out during the ceremony.&ldquo;I thought, I can&rsquo;t sit here and feel sorry for myself. I&rsquo;m leaving and wish my mum could follow us. It&rsquo;s clear that some people didn&rsquo;t want us there,&rdquo; Gugu sobbed.Other family members also voiced their disappointment to the SunTeam.A close relative said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;d rather wait for our mum to come out. Only then will we know if we&rsquo;re going to the cemetery.&rdquo;Gugu said Ayanda and a pastor had refused a request by Sfiso&rsquo;s mum. She wanted his remains to rest for a time at her house before being taken to the stadium. During the funeral, speaker after speaker sang the fallen singer&rsquo;s praises. The MCs were Ukhozi FM&rsquo;s Dudu Khoza and Linda Sibiya. High-profile mourners included First Ladies Tobeka Madiba-Zuma and Nompumelelo MaNtuli Zuma, singer Thobekile Mkhwanazi, DJ Tira, Babes Wodumo, Zakes Bantwini, Zanele Mbokazi, Menzi Ngubane, T&rsquo;zozo, Sipho Makhabane, Tshepo Nzimande, Khaya Mthethwa, Nhlanhla Mdlalose, Kay Sibiya, MEC for KZN&rsquo;s department of economic development Sihle Zikalala and eThekwini Municipality Mayor Zandile Gumede.
