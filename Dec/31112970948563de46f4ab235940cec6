OPERATION Vala is clamping down on illegal initiation schools in the Vaal, Gauteng. Yesterday, 15 boys and eight girls were rescued in Sebokeng and Eatonside.Cops and municipal officials raided several initiation camps from early in the morning. They were travelling in dozens of marked police vehicles and a police helicopter. The initiates were found deep inside the bush of a popular summer initiation hot spot known as Toreng.This is the same place where the body of an initiate, Lehlohonolo Nyamba (42), was found buried in a shallow grave last year. Another initiate, Eric Mokhele (16), from Orange Farm was last seen alive in 2012. He is believed to be dead and buried in the mountains.Now Mphephi Hlongwane is praying that her son, Katleho (15), does not suffer the same fate. Katleho left home on Saturday and was never seen again.Mphephi said she realised after reading his WhatsApp messages that he might have gone to an initiation school without her consent.Yesterday, Mphephi formed part of the raid with the cops in the hope of finding Katleho, but with no luck. The heartbroken mum has pleaded with residents who may have information about her son&rsquo;s whereabouts to come forward.Solomon Mofokeng, chairman of the Sedibeng Initiation Forum, led the raids. He said Operation Vala has helped identify illegal initiation practitioners and their schools.Yusuf Mahommed, a member of the mayoral committee for public safety in Sedibeng, said residents should report all illegal initiation schools.Police spokesman Captain Teboho Lephoto said four men have been arrested and charged with abduction.
