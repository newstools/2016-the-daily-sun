THE only place left for former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng is jail, said DA leader Mmusi Maimane after the party won its application to have his appointment as group executive of corporate affairs declared unlawful."I'm delighted and I think justice has been served today," said Maimane after the Western Cape High Court in Cape Town said Motsoeneng could not hold any position at the broadcaster unless a Public Protector's 2014 report on his appointment as COO is overturned and a new disciplinary inquiry clears him."I think Hlaudi Motsoeneng should not be working at the SABC," said Maimane after shaking hands with advocate Anton Katz SC who led the DA's legal attack on Motsoeneng's appointment.The court set aside the findings of a disciplinary committee that acquitted Motsoeneng on allegations emanating from the Public Protector's report. These included that he could not produce the matric certificate he claimed to have and that he allegedly illegally awarded himself salary increases. It ordered that a new disciplinary inquiry be held and set strict timelines.After losing a court appeal to a previous DA application setting aside his appointment as COO, Motsoeneng was appointed group executive for corporate affairs. The court declared that appointment invalid and unconstitutional. Motsoeneng also has to pay costs out of his own pocket."I welcome the judgment and I am glad he has to pay costs personally. He must stop wasting tax payer's money on his personal litigation."His next move is to go to jail," said Maimane.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/the-only-place-for-motsoeneng-now-is-jail-maimane-20161212
