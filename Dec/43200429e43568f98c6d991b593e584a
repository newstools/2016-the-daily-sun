CAPE Town City coach Eric Tinkler says SuperSport United feared them &ndash; and that gave his charges the confidence to run riot and attack. City were crowned Telkom Knockout champions on Saturday after defeating Matsatsantsa a Pitori 2-1 in an entertaining cup final in Polokwane. &ldquo;SuperSport, to a degree, feared us. We started the game very well. Every time we transitioned, they backed off and gave us of space and time. We got the early goal, which put them on the backfoot. They started to change their game slightly and played long balls, which is not their type of football. &ldquo;That worked in our favour. We were just well-structured and organised in the first half,&rdquo; said Tinkler. City&rsquo;s story is the stuff of fairy-tales. The club is barely six months old but the team&rsquo;s players and staff have outdone themselves. They&rsquo;ve also had a fantastic start in the league. If they don&rsquo;t have a trophy cabinet in their makeshift offices yet, they most definitely will need one now! Who knows, the TKO trophy may have to remain in owner John Comitis&rsquo; car boot for a while.However, they almost gave it away with their wasteful ways on Saturday and Tinkler admitted it was not the most clinical of victories.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it was a great performance by us. But I think we have done enough to win the game, deservedly so. I am extremely proud of myself, of the boys and the team,&rdquo; Tinkler added. The former Bafana Bafana hardman said he never thought they would achieve this much because their main focus had been on the league. But the celebrations are over and now it&rsquo;s back to the league programme for City, who host Platinum Stars at the Athlone Stadium tomorrow (7.30pm) and then meet SuperSport at the Cape Town Stadium in a league clash on Friday (6pm).
