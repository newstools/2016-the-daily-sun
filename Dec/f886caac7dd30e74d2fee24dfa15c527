CEBOLENKOSI &ldquo;Khazozo&rdquo; Makhaza (22) won&rsquo;t let blindness get in the way of his dream of making it big as a singer one day!The 22-year-old from Kwamdakane in KZN is one of the most highly praised artists in his community. His sense of humour and dedication to his music has earned him airplay on local community radio stations. But, for Khazozo, that is not enough. He feels his music needs to touch the rest of the world.He said: &ldquo;My first love is my guitar. I cannot see it but I feel its beauty and the music rings in my ears. &ldquo;I compose my own songs because I feel we all have a different story to tell. My experiences as a blind man have helped me realise the power I have.&rdquo; Khazozo believes there are still a lot of people with disabilities who remain sidelined with no guidance and support. &ldquo;I believe that disabled people have the mental capacity to achieve what they want and they show more dedication to their craft than able-bodied people,&rdquo; he said.Khazozo said he wanted to change how people living with disabilities see themselves as a lot of them, especially in the rural areas, are excluded. &ldquo;Some are even locked up inside their homes. This needs to change. We need to be shown support and included in youth programmes.&rdquo; The dedicated guitarist said he was ready to reconcile people with the Lord through his soulful music.&ldquo;I also want to spread a message of love because I&rsquo;m looking forward to having someone I call the love of my life, someone who will accept me for who I am and see beyond my blindness.&rdquo;
