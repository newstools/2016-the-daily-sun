FIRST HE robbed them and then he threatened to rape them.&nbsp; When his 4-5 flopped, he phoned for backup which didn&rsquo;t come.&nbsp; THEN HE DID WHAT ALL COWARDS DO: HE RAN AWAY.&nbsp; Pretty Moyo (25) told Daily Sun a thug broke into her house in Ebony Park, Tembisa near Joburg on Monday night.&ldquo;He came into my bedroom carrying a gun. He forced me to go to my sister&rsquo;s room with him,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;He fired shots into the air. We were trembling and did what he told us.&rdquo; Threatening to destroy the house, he told Pretty and her 26-year-old sister to unplug the TVs and computers and carry them outside.But their ordeal was a long way from over.As they were carrying the appliances he led them into the bushes and told them to strip naked. &ldquo;He wanted to rape us,&rdquo; she said.That&rsquo;s when Pretty and her sister started praying.&ldquo;I was praying to God that the man would not rape us.&rdquo;Pretty claimed their prayers killed his manhood, because even with two naked young women in front of him his 4-5 fell flat.Even when he forced them to touch his 4-5, it never became erect.&ldquo;He was discouraged,&rdquo; said Pretty. &ldquo;Instead, he hit me on the head with a firearm.&rdquo;Then the thug took them to a room and told them he was going to fetch his friends.&ldquo;He spoke on his phone and then he left,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;After a while we realised he had gone and the room was not locked. We ran outside to the nearest house, where people took us in and called the police.&rdquo;She said cops helped them fetch their belongings and they took them home.&rdquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy the man didn&rsquo;t rape us. We recovered all our belongings except for our two cellphones.&rdquo;Pretty said it was the worst moment of her life as they spent half the night in the bushes with the thug.&ldquo;Whenever I try to sleep I think of our night of terror. &ldquo;It keeps me awake.&rdquo; Sangoma Manhliza Dlamini said Pretty&rsquo;s ancestors were strong and saved her from the rapist. &ldquo;Their ancestors prevented him from getting an erection.&rdquo; Police spokesman Captain Manyadza Ralidzhivha said police were investigating cases of house robbery and kidnapping and are looking for the suspect, who is still on the run.
