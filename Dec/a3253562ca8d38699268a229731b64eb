WATTVILLE thugs have no respect for the dead!They have taken to raping women right inside the Wattville Cemetery &ndash; on top of the graves. Angry residents of the Ekurhuleni kasi said the act is not only criminal, but also a display of utter disrespect towards their ancestors, and it has to stop.According to residents, at least seven women have fallen victim to the graveyard rapists. Women who are walking to or from work are mostly targeted by the heartless thugs.Residents said the thugs hide among the graves and wait for the women. Once they see them, they pounce.They drag their victims further into the graveyard where they rape them.&ldquo;People have lost respect for our culture. We must not allow bad elements to get away with it. &ldquo;Graveyards used to be respected but now they a like parks,&rdquo; said community leader Peter Ndlovu.He put part of the blame on the municipality.&ldquo;We reported the matter to the municipality and they came up with a plan to instal lights in February this year, so the thugs could be seen. But the lights have still not been switched on.&ldquo;The municipality&rsquo;s lack of action shows they are not taking crime seriously. Other graveyards have security guards, but ours is just a walk in the park for criminals.&rdquo;Benoni police Captain Ramothakhi Maqabe confirmed several women were raped in the cemetery.Municipal spokesman Themba Gadebe said they are busy erecting a fence to stop thugs from entering the cemetery. He said the municipality will be attending to the lighting issue as soon as possible.
