One of them threatened to blow off my head.&rdquo; The money belongs to the stokvel, which has 22 members. They were planning to use it to give their families a happy Christmas.Francinah told the SunTeam they started their Kutlwano society in January and members contributed R200 a month. The two gogos with Francinah were Josephine Masebe (68) and Lenah Ngake (62). They were driven by Joel Thebedi (65). Society member Aletta Ngakane (80) started crying when she heard the money had been stolen. &ldquo;I was going to get R3 850 and it was enough to buy porridge and meat for my family,&rdquo; she said.Joel said thugs pointed a pistol at him to force him to open the window.
