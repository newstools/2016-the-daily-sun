MADALA Jones Kgafela (75) from Mmametlhake, Mpumalanga died a gruesome death.His loved ones believe he was killed last Friday, but his body was only found on Sunday morning.His younger brother, Obed Kgafela (64), said he was shocked when he found his brother&rsquo;s body.&ldquo;We were worried because his lights were on but we had not heard from him for two days. &ldquo;When we went to check up on him, there was a bad smell in the yard. &ldquo;We immediately knew he was dead,&rdquo; said Obed.&ldquo;We were shocked when we opened the door and saw bloody footprints. &ldquo;We found his body covered in blood and there was a pillow over his face. &ldquo;My brother had bruises and a swollen neck, proving that they tried to strangle him. &ldquo;He had bled through his mouse and nose.&rdquo; The madala&rsquo;s pension money, clothes and new blankets were stolen.&ldquo;I still cannot believe the killer was so cruel. &ldquo;My brother was old and probably couldn&rsquo;t fight back. &ldquo;The killer could have just taken his money and left.&ldquo;Thugs have tried to kill him before. Last year he was choked and left to die, but he survived. The thugs took advantage of the fact that he was living alone. They have been targeting him for years and robbing him off his money. &ldquo;He often said he was too scared to sleep alone and kept the light on the whole night.&rdquo;&ldquo;He was a good man who was loved by many in the community. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t have any enemies. &ldquo;We want the police to find the killers and lock them up. &ldquo;They are a danger to the community because they target the elderly,&rdquo; said Obed.Police spokeswoman Warrant Officer Nhlahla Kgosana said no case was opened.She said: &ldquo;The police spoke to the family and it was agreed that a case will not be opened.&rdquo; However, Warrant Officer Kgosana added that madala Jones&rsquo;s body was taken to a government mortuary.
