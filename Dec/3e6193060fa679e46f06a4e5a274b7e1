Cape Town City goalkeeper Shuaib Walters has credited the squads togetherness for their early-season success, despite the club being less than six months old.Eric Tinkler's men face SuperSport United in the Telkom Knockout final at New Peter Mokaba Stadium this coming Saturday, just six months after the owner John Comitis bought the status of Mpumalanga Black Aces and relocated them to the Western Cape.Apart from their run to the cup final, City are also leading the Premiership table.They will travel to Polokwane this weekend on the back of a fabulous run of nine matches unbeaten in all competitions, eight of those being victories."We obviously had to be accommodating when we just arrived and we had to be patient," Walters told Vodacom Soccer. "They always talk about humble beginnings and stuff like that... I think what is working for us is that we've got a great team and good players who understand one another."If I'm not mistaken, I think Aubrey Ngoma is top of the assist list, so that shows understanding between players. I think it is just the way we have gone on and built up on continuity, because the team has been working together for 18 months now as the core."Walters, who joined the team when it was then known as Mpumalanga Black Aces at the start of last season, believes they have the nucleus to now kick on and win silverware."The core of this team was here, which I think is a good thing and that is also helping," he added. "The understanding of players, as I&rsquo;ve alluded to, the understanding of one another."When Aubrey runs this way, Manyama goes the other way, when (Bongolwethu) Jayiya goes this way, (Sbusiso) Masina goes the other way, so it&rsquo;s all things that we have been doing in the last 18 months which we are reaping the rewards of now."
