IT&rsquo;S WAR in court while a chief&rsquo;s body stays in the mortuary! Last Tuesday, the Mthatha High Court ordered advocate Mwelo Nonkonyane to submit his application to the Bloemfontein High Court in the dispute between the late Chief Velile Mkono&rsquo;s two wives. The chief&rsquo;s body has been lying in the mortuary since 7 November last year. The chief&rsquo;s first wife Noncedile Mkono died in a car accident two weeks ago. The case has appeared before the Mthatha High court over 10 times. Now, the dispute is about the legitimacy of the chief&rsquo;s will and of Noncedile&rsquo;s marriage status.Last week, Nonkonyane filed papers asking permission to replace Noncedile with reigning Chief Velile Mkono.Judge Robert Griffiths ordered that it must be filed in Bloemfontein.The late wife, who was the applicant in the matter, will be buried on Saturday at Mchonkco, in Ngqeleni.Nonkonyane said: &ldquo;Soon we will file our application in Bloemfontein. It is clear it will be heard in January. The court made it clear this matter is urgent.&rdquo;He said they had written to lawyers for the younger wife, asking them to allow the chief&rsquo;s body to be buried in a neutral place as it has been in the mortuary for 13 months.Nonzwakazi&rsquo;s son, Saziso Mkono, said they are seeking an urgent interdict preventing burial of the first wife&rsquo;s body at any of his father&rsquo;s homesteads. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re preparing to file court papers because my father was divorcing Noncedile, so she no longer belonged to the family,&rdquo; said angry Saziso.
