THE names of three inmates who died in a prison riot on Monday have been released. They lost their lives after about 30 convicts attacked warders at St Alban&rsquo;s Prison in Greenbushes, outside Port Elizabeth, while being led from their cells to breakfast. The fighting left 13 warders injured, six of them in a critical condition. At least 19 inmates were injured during the incident. Prisoners claimed the attack was caused by misconduct and ill treatment by warders. A prisoner told Daily Sun they stabbed warders in order to get the attention of the authorities. They accused warders of abusing them and not giving them a chance to exercise. Police Captain Sandra van Rensburg said: &ldquo;The dead inmates have been indentified as Bonisile Khayingo (42), Mziyanda Mata (24) and Luzuko Ncokazi (22). Khayingo was sentenced to 15 years in prison for assault and robbery in 2011. Mata was serving a lengthy sentence for robbery following his conviction last year, while Ncokazi was convicted and sentenced to eight years for a 2013 murder.&rdquo; Nkosinathi Breakfast, Correctional Services provincial commissioner, said: &ldquo;A lockdown of the maximum security section of the prison and stopping family visits are just two of the measures that have been put in place to deal with the matter. We hope the prison will be back to normal for visits by the weekend.&rdquo;
