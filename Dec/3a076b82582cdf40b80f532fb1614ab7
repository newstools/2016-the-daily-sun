&ldquo;IGAZI lo muntu liyakhuluma&rdquo; is what the family of Sikhosiphi Khubisa (38) believes! They are convinced that their dead family member&rsquo;s blood will indeed speak. The naked body of the 38-year-old from the Nsuze area in KZN was found in a cave last week. His decomposed body was discovered by boys who were playing in the hills near his home. Sikhosiphi had been missing for two weeks. He was last seen leaving a tavern after fighting with some men there. Allegedly, they followed him when he left the tavern.On Friday night, three suspects were arrested in connection with the murder. Apparently, the men disappeared immediately after Sikhosiphi went missing. They returned on Friday, only to walk into the hands of the police. Vusumuzi Khubisa (42) is convinced that his brother&rsquo;s blood and his spirit is guiding them. &ldquo;The fact that the police made an arrest soon after Sikhosiphi&rsquo;s body was found proves that his spirit is on a mission to seek justice.&ldquo;People who kill other people must not forget that a person&rsquo;s blood also speaks. &ldquo;I always pray and urge my brother&rsquo;s spirit to make sure his killers get what they deserve. Then maybe we will get closure.&rdquo; Vusumuzi said the family truly believes Sikhosiphi&rsquo;s spirit will make sure justice is done.&ldquo;Although my brother is dead, his spirit lives. It will throw all his killers in jail for a long time. &ldquo;Those who killed him will feel the heat,&rdquo; said Vusumuzi.KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed that police in Nsuze have arrested three suspects aged 17&ndash;22 for the murder.She said they are expected to appear in the KwaMaphumulo Magistrates Court soon.
