ASINATHI Lisa is known in his community as a hard-working painter and carpenter. He&rsquo;s been working for residents of Etwatwa, in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, for over five years. But on Monday night, some kasi residents decided Asinathi was a nyaope dealer and burned down the 23-year-old&rsquo;s two-roomed shack while he was finishing a painting job! When Asinathi came home, there was nothing waiting for him but warm ash. Some people in the crowd had begged the mob not to set his shack on fire but they were ignored.The young painter told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I work very hard for my money. Everybody knows what I do for a living and that I would never sell drugs. I don&rsquo;t even know what they&rsquo;re talking about.&ldquo;Now everything I worked for has gone. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even have a place to stay.&rdquo;Asinathi said all he had left were the clothes he was wearing and two paintbrushes. Even his savings went up in flames. &ldquo;My ID and my brother&rsquo;s ID burned along with all my clothes, pots and groceries. &ldquo;The R1 000 I&rsquo;d saved for December is also gone.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do. These people are so cruel.&rdquo; The attack on Asinathi&rsquo;s home comes after three similar incidents, all carried out in the name of getting rid of nyaope dealers. Three shacks were torched last Thursday in the same area after the occupants were accused of selling nyaope.An angry resident told Daily Sun: &ldquo;This was to teach them a lesson.&rdquo; A case of arson has been opened at Etwatwa Police Station and is being investigated.
