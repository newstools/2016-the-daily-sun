CIVIL claims against the Eastern Cape police now stand at an amazing R51 million!The sum consists of 781 payments claimed by civil litigants in compensation for violent abuse at the hands of the police. Some of the cases include wrongful arrests, shootings, assault, defamation and negligence. A further R3,5 billion in claims is still pending.This was revealed by safety and liaison MEC Weziwe Tikane, who was responding to a question in the Eastern Cape legislature on Thursday.&ldquo;The issue of civil claims has been identified as one of the risk areas for the police and is monitored at the provincial risk enterprise committee. On a monthly basis management is providing statistics regarding civil claims with a view to implementing proactive measures for reduction,&rdquo; said Tikane.Bobby Stevenson, DA leader in the legislature, said: &ldquo;The R51 million is almost double the R28,3 million paid out in the 2015/16 financial year.&ldquo;This is the result of poor training and a lack of accountability, such as adhering to the basics like writing up their pocket book. &ldquo;The good name and reputation of our hardworking policemen and women who work under difficult circumstance should not be tarnished by the actions of lawless elements who simply want to do as they please. The police must uphold and promote a culture of human rights and adhere to the rule of law.&rdquo;Police spokeswoman Colonel Sibongile Soci said: &ldquo;We have taken note of the report but we cannot comment further.&rdquo;
