RESIDENTS of Glenariff Farm in Glendale, KZN pray that justice takes its course in the rape and assault case of a 30-year-old suspect.The suspect allegedly raped his younger sister (15) repeatedly since the death of their mum in 2014.Neighbours claimed that the suspect threatened his sister and said she would kill her if she told anyone. A neighbour (43), who found out what was happening, told Daily Sun that they don&rsquo;t want the suspect to get bail, because that would traumatise the victim.&ldquo;We noticed that he was beating the child, but we didn&rsquo;t notice that he was also raping her. We only learnt about it two weeks ago. This was after the girl fled from home to live with a boyfriend,&rdquo; said the neighbour.KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed the incident. &ldquo;A 30-year-old suspect was arrested and appeared in the KwaDukuza Magistrates Court last Wednesday. &ldquo;He was kept in jail until he appears in court again on Wednesday for a formal bail application,&rdquo; said Gwala.
