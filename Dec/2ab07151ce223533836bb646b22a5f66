HE&rsquo;S not only a sangoma with spiritual powers, but also a tough fighter.On Saturday Musa Mdluli (38) was surrounded by three thugs. They had a knife, a screwdriver and a gun.&ldquo;Hand over your phone or die!&rdquo; they told him. But the sangoma from Etwatwa in Ekurhuleni decided to teach the thugs a lesson. He ran towards two of the thugs and punched their heads, causing them to drop their weapons and flee. Musa said: &ldquo;They could see I was on fire, even though I&rsquo;d been stabbed in the head and was bleeding. &ldquo;The thug with the gun put it to my head and told me to say my final prayers.&ldquo;But I moered that gunman and his weapon fell to the ground. When he tried to pick it up, I landed a big punch on his face and he went to sleep.&rdquo; As the sangoma was about to pick up the weapon, it was grabbed by a fourth thug, standing guard, who tossed the gun to the first two thugs and told them to leave. The three men ran away with Musa&rsquo;s phone.The angry sangoma went to open a case against the three thugs and a separate case against the fourth, who helped the others get away. &ldquo;But the cops told me they can only open a case against the three thugs, because the fourth one helped me. But he was helping his friends, not me.&rdquo;Police spokesman Captain Pheello Mothapo advised Musa to come to the police station and explain his story so cops can fix his statement.He said: &ldquo;A case of robbery has been opened.&rdquo;
