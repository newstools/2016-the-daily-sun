Dear MizzB&nbsp; I am a single mother of two daughters. I have to work long hours to provide for them. &nbsp;I do not get to spend much time with them and they are growing so quickly. How do I teach them to abstain from sex? My parents did not teach me about sex, and I had to rely on friends who did not always have good advice. Please help me teach my girls the correct way.&nbsp; - &thinsp;Anonymous&nbsp; Dear Anonymous The earlier you start talking them about sex, the better.&nbsp;Use the correct terms for private parts, as nicknames promote shame and secrecy.&nbsp;However, only give them information that is appropriate for their age. Listen to what they have to say about the matter. Teach them about their rights, responsibilities and the consequences of having sex.&nbsp;
