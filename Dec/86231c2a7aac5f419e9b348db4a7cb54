AUDITOR-General Kimi Makwetu said poor communication and monitoring was the cause of delays in service delivery.Yesterday, he said improving the allocation of resources is critical in enabling service delivery.Makwetu released the findings of service delivery audits on health, water infrastructure and urban renewal projects between 2015 and 2016.He said the audit on pharmaceuticals was undertaken to determine whether medicines were managed properly.The water infrastructure report examined the performance of water projects.Makwetu said the audit of the urban renewal programme was done at the request of provincial departments such as human settlements and co-operative governance.He said townships such as Evaton, Winterveld and Bekkersdal suffered as the budgets allocated to them where nowhere near the amount agreed upon.Evaton was suppose to receive R3,7 billion, but only received R260 million. Winterveld&rsquo;s budget was R4,3 billion, but received R278 million. Bekkersdal&rsquo;s budget was set at R1,2 billion but it received R440 million.&ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t fix this, they risk having more problems in the health, water and infrastructure departments in future.&rdquo;
