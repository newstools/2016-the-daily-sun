EMPLOYEES of Umzinyathi Municipality who were allegedly put on unpaid special leave will have a black Christmas. The employees told Daily Sun the municipality in the north of KZN couldn&rsquo;t pay them. It was facing financial problems caused by the delay in electing leaders after the August local government election. According to three employees the SunTeam spoke to, it was not yet clear how many of them would be affected. One employee said: &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t told when we could come back to work when we were put on special leave last month.&rdquo;Another employee said they had been told they might be back at work after the leadership problems were sorted out. &ldquo;However, it&rsquo;s clear we&rsquo;ll have a bad Christmas,&rdquo; said the employee. KZN co-operative governance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube placed the municipality under administration in October after it failed to elect a government. Umzinyathi municipal spokeswoman Nomonde Nzimakwe confirmed that some employees were at home but denied that they were given special leave.&ldquo;Their contracts were not renewed. Cogta has appointed an administrator to oversee all executive matters in the municipality and to make sure that service delivery is not compromised any way.&rdquo;
