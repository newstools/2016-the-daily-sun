Several affected villages have been left without water.Said Moses: &ldquo;Vhembe District Municipality condemns such barbaric acts as they reverse the gains of freedom since 1994, and deny the people of Vhembe their right to service delivery within their areas.&rdquo;He noted that the theft and vandalism of the water supply network had come at the worst possible time in the province. Many dam levels are decreasing in the severe drought which still has all of Mzansi in its grip.
