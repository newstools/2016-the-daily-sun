THE Zimbabwean government has urged villagers to evacuate low-lying areas after floods swept away more than 30 people and destroyed homes and schools in parts of the country.About 400 homes and 13 schools were swept away following heavy storms in areas such as Bulilima, Mangwe and Nkayi.Zimbabwe fears for the worst after the country&rsquo;s civil protection unit forecast more downpours and violent floods ahead of the festive season.The protection unit is working with international humanitarian organisations such as the Red Cross and the World Food Programme to provide various forms of assistance to the victims.Environment minister Oppah Muchinguri said: &ldquo;With the expected heavy rains in mind, we appeal to the public to take precautions.&ldquo;They should avoid crossing flooded rivers and stay away from low-lying areas which are vulnerable to flooding.&rdquo;She warned the heavy rains could spread waterborne diseases in areas with poor sanitation services.A cholera outbreak claimed hundreds of lives in 2008.Local government minister Saviour Kasukuwere said cash-strapped urban areas were at risk of flash flooding as a result of blocked drains.Kasukuwere said: &ldquo;All towns and cities have been instructed to urgently attend to these issues.&rdquo; &ndash; CAJ NEWS
