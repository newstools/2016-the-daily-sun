COPS are hunting for a 4-5 fiddler who describes himself as a Satanist! The suspect allegedly went into his victim&rsquo;s room and sexually assaulted him before robbing him of his money, cellphone and other belongings. The victim from Kagiso in Mogale City described the suspect as a handsome man who looks innocent. Captain Solomon Sibiya from Kagiso Police Station confirmed the cops were looking for a man accused of sexually assaulting another man. &ldquo;The complainant says he was on his way home from church last weekend when he came across the suspect near his house,&rdquo; said Sibiya. The captain said the suspect approached the complainant and told him he had information about items that had been stolen from him. The complainant told the cops the suspect asked him for R1 500 to provide him with information. The complainant invited the man into his room because he was eager to know more about his stolen property. &ldquo;He let the suspect into his room at the back of a house. Once they were inside, the suspect allegedly took out an unknown object and pointed it at the complainant. The complainant&rsquo;s body became numb and powerless.&rdquo; He said the suspect started going through the room, stealing cash, a cellphone and clothes.&ldquo;He once again pointed the object at the complainant. The victim was then sexually assaulted before the suspect told him he was a Satanist and left. The complainant tried to follow him but the suspect had disappeared.&rdquo; The Kagiso police appealed to any member of the public who might know something about the incident to call the sexual offences unit on 083 727 6809.
