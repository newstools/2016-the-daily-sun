TEMPERS ran high on Monday when hawkers stormed a construction site at a mall and torched a truck! The vendors were angry because renovations at Denneboom Mall in Mamelodi West, Tshwane, meant that the taxi rank would be moved. They feared it would lead to fewer customers. A vendor said if they moved to the new taxi rank they would lose the business of commuters who got out at Denneboom Railway Station, which was close to the old rank. &ldquo;We want things to remain the way they are. There is nothing wrong with this mall. Why do they want to renovate it? They just want to give their friends tenders.&rdquo; The vendors vowed that they would not move. &ldquo;We are still going to torch many trucks and we will burn down the mall before renovations are completed. They must bring police to guard the construction site or there won&rsquo;t be any mall.&rdquo; Khomotso Mpheregwane (40), a concerned resident, said: &ldquo;These people are only thinking of their profits. What about the young people who want construction jobs? We want the mall to be finished so this chaos can end.&rdquo; She said construction could be completed if the cops arrested the vendors. &ldquo;They should make an example by arresting a few of these vendors so the mall can be completed. They must remember this mall is for everyone and not only the vendors.&rdquo; Captain Johannes Maheso, Mamelodi West police spokesman, confirmed the incident but said no one was arrested.
