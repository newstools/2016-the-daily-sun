BAROKA FC goalkeeper Oscarine Masuluke scored what has been the goal of the season so far in the sixth minute of injury time with a spectacular overhead kick to earn his club a dramatic but deserved 1-1 draw against an out of sorts Orlando Pirates.With seconds remaining the Giyani born keeper came up for a corner and did what his strikers failed to do and found the net with that stunning goal from the edge of the area to earn Bakgaga a share of the spoils. Said Baraka head coach Kgoloko Thobejane of the goal: &ldquo;That was simply brilliant.&rdquo; Baroka proved every bit as difficult as Orlando Pirates interim coach Augusto Palacios predicted.Baroka impressed with the way they took the game to their more experienced opponents and even when they went a goal down against the run of play never stopped running at the hard pressed Bucs rear guard.Bucs leading goal scorer Tendai Ndoro who has scored nine of the 11 goals scored in the league so far was almost invisible.It&rsquo;s amazing that Baroka had failed to win any league match played at home this season. Both their league wins were away to Platinum Stars (1-0) and Cape Town City (2-1).Baroka were the better side in the opening half and had Pirates defence under a lot of pressure where goalkeeper Jackson Mabokgwane was one of the busiest Bucs players on the pitch.Bakgaga were the better organised side both in attack and defence and rarely gave Bucs a chance in the opening first half.But things changed three minutes after the break when Pirates defender Justice Chabalala stabbed home a corner while Baroka players complained to referee Philip Tiyani that goalkeeper Masuluke had been impeded. However, the match official waved away Baroka&rsquo;s passionate appeals.But Masculine had the last say with that last second goal that will be talked about in Limpopo and Mzansi for years to come.Free State Stars moved off the bottom of the table with a 3-1 home win over Platinum Stars to 15th position on eight points. Golden Arrows shared a six goal thrilled (3-3) in last night&rsquo;s other fixture played at the King Zwelithini Stadium.
