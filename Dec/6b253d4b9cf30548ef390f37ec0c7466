After drawing 1-1 with Kaizer Chiefs in their previous league game, Cape Town City coach Eric Tinkler believes Bidvest Wits will provide a much stiffer test in Friday's Premiership encounter.City, who hold a one point advantage at the top of the standings over SuperSport United and Wits, face the Clever Boys in Johannesburg.&nbsp;Despite being held to a draw against an unpredictable Glamour Boys outfit, Tinkler takes the view that lessons can be learnt from the performance going into Friday's clash.He told reporters: "(Wits will be) much stronger to be honest, if we come out the way we did (against Chiefs) we will get punished - this is a hard lesson for the boys."The former Orlando Pirates coach also urged his side to forget about reaching the Telkom Knockout final against SuperSport on 10 December at Peter Mokaba Stadium.He added: "I know they are possibly still thinking of what happened on the weekend and the positive result we got there (a 4-1 win against Free State State Stars in the semi-final), but really - we should have come for three points (against Chiefs), not one."Meanwhile, Gavin Hunt's men are expected to be without five key players in Thulani Hlatshwayo, Buhle Mkhwanazi, Sifiso Hlanti, Xola Mlambo and Thabang Monare.&nbsp;Hlatshwayo has a broken finger, Mkhwanazi is coming back from a broken nose, Hlanti is suspended while Mlambo and Monare are recovering from ankle and hamstring injuries respectively.City have fewer concerns and are unbeaten in their last eight matches in all competitions. Friday's action gets underway from 20:00 at Bidvest Stadium in Milpark.
