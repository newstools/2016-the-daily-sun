IT LOOKS like an ordinary armband.But Tshepo Lenka says it protects him from evil.The tuckshop owner claims it saved his life on Thursday night when hitmen were sent to kill him!According to Tshepo, of Wattville, Ekurhuleni, his armband warned him in advance that something bad was about to happen. He told the SunTeam: &ldquo;It was midnight and I felt uneasy. The band was making my arm itch to alert me that trouble was on its way. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t ignore it. I did what it was telling me to do.&rdquo; Tshepo said he jumped over a wall and hid in his neighbour&rsquo;s yard.&ldquo;After a few minutes I heard voices, and my gate open. They called my name and demanded that I should come out and face them. I recognised one of the voices.&rdquo;Tshepo claims the men ransacked his house and stole cash. He told Daily Sun that his sangoma uncle had made the armband for him several weeks earlier, when he started getting death threats. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m running a business and some people are not happy that I&rsquo;m doing well,&rdquo; he said.Tshepo says residents support him: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about how you run your business and how you treat people. That&rsquo;s my only sin &ndash; treating my customers well so they come back.&ldquo;But now, with my magic armband, I&rsquo;m not scared. Nobody can hurt me, and for this I thank my ancestors.&rdquo; Lenka said he knows who is behind the plan to get rid of him.
