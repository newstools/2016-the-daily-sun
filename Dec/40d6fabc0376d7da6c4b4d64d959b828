SIBUSISO Mabhena survived his long-time friend Sfiso Ncwane&rsquo;s funeral in Durban.But on Sunday evening, the 31-year-old collapsed while watching a tribute to the gospel star on TV. He regained consciousness in hospital, where he was told he had suffered a heart attack. Sibusiso from Tweefontein, near KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga, is still recovering in hospital. He said when he saw his friend&rsquo;s coffin being lowered into the ground on TV, he suddenly realised he would never see Sfiso again.&ldquo;I was very emotional after I returned from the funeral in Durban. Watching the tribute on TV was the last straw.&ldquo;I felt my heart pounding and my chest felt like it was going to explode. I don&rsquo;t know what happened after that.&rdquo;Doctors told Sibusiso he had suffered a heart attack and advised him not to think about his late friend too much. &ldquo;It will take me a long time to accept my friend&rsquo;s death. Sibusiso held a memorial service for Sfiso in Witbank last Thursday. He said about 7 000 people came to pay their last respect.
