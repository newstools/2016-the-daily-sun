Closing arguments in ANC NEC member Tony Yengeni&rsquo;s drunk driving trial are expected to be heard in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. Defence lawyer Waheed Badrodien previously said Yengeni was looking forward to the matter being finalised "one way or the other".Yengeni was arrested in Green Point, Cape Town, on Sunday August 12, 2013 after being pulled over while apparently driving his white Maserati erratically.He previously testified that just three sips of traditional African beer had passed his lips that day.Yengeni told the court he had been at a family gathering for a traditional ceremony in Gugulethu earlier in the afternoon and had had nothing else apart from the three sips to drink.He said he had drunk umqombothi (home-brewed beer) many times before without incident, and that it had a low alcohol content compared to spirits.The politician previously shared suspicions about his prosecution and the possibility of a political conspiracy against him.In a separate matter in 2007, Yengeni was found not guilty of drunk driving after he was arrested in Goodwood, Cape Town. http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/yengeni-drunk-driving-trial-back-in-court-20161213
