THIS could be Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela&rsquo;s second last match in charge of Amakhosi.If he doesn&rsquo;t pull of a victory against Polokwane City today, then Amakhosi&rsquo;s last game before Christmas could be most probably his last.Komphela knows he has to, at least, get four points from their two remaining fixtures or else his head will be on the block.The Soweto giants have been struggling to get results in the Premiership as they have managed to get only four victories in 13 fixtures.Their dismal form has lead them to eight matches (in all competitions) without victory and this has resulted in Chiefs fans calling for coach Komphela&rsquo;s head. Chiefs&rsquo; last win was when they defeated Ajax Cape Town 2-0, two months ago.Today&rsquo;s assignment against Polokwane will again be played at FNB Stadium, the same venue where Komphela was escorted out to safety by cops on Wednesday. Kick-off is at 3.30pm.Chiefs will then visit Golden Arrows at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Wednesday to wrap up the year.Komphela said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking for something that&rsquo;s going to boost our confidence &ndash; a present for our fans. We host Polokwane, it&rsquo;s another three points that we have to fight for. It will be tough they are well-structured and play with lots of discipline.&ldquo;Offensively, they do come out with a good structure. Jabu Maluleke is a big player They can play and also give you problems with set-pieces.&rdquo;Komphela said he&rsquo;s looking forward to the break for his lads to regroup.&ldquo;When we go for the break at the back of good results you enjoy the break. We hope to win the two matches so that when we go for Christmas it becomes the break worth then you can look forward to it, but it becomes too long if the results were not forth coming.&rdquo;He told SunSport: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward to the break maybe it will ease pressure on us.&rdquo;Komphela relishes the coming back of Sibusiso Khumalo and Willard Katsande who were not part of the squad that played against Bloemfontein Celtic.&ldquo;Khumalo is coming back and I would celebrate without saying the one who was playing there was not doing a good job, he will be helping us.&ldquo;Katsande is also coming back I hope George Maluleka and George Lebese will be ready for the City game,&rdquo; he said.
