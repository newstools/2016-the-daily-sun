FOR seven years, she and her children suffered at the hands of an abusive man.The man was sentenced to prison, but Josephine Mokwena (42) from Northam, Limpopo is still living in fear.That&rsquo;s because the man was sent to jail for just a year for assault &ndash; and he has allegedly already threatened to kill her and the kids when he gets out!Josephine said the prosecutor refused to appeal the sentence. &ldquo;I was told to get a protection order, but it&rsquo;s only a piece of paper. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t stop him from killing me,&rdquo; she said. Josephine said she and the man, who is originally from Burundi, had a customary marriage back in 2009.&ldquo;He paid lobola seven years ago and asked me to stop working.&ldquo;Then he changed. &ldquo;He would lock me and my kids in the house, and beat us with a car fan belt, even for small things like changing the TV channel.&ldquo;Last November, I called a friend to unlock the house, and we went to lay criminal charges,&rdquo; said Josephine.The man was arrested last December and sentenced earlier this month. While on trial, he allegedly threatened to kill her and the kids. &ldquo;I told the judge to lock him up for 20 years because my kids shiver at the mention of his name.&ldquo;But he was sentenced to just one year,&rdquo; she said.Josephine also claims the man&rsquo;s asylum papers expired in 2010.Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi, spokeswoman for the National Prosecuting Authority, confirmed the man&rsquo;s sentence, adding that they considered it suitable.Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said only South Africans were permitted to enter into customary marriages. He added: &ldquo;Once a convicted foreigner has served a sentence, he or she is transferred to the custody of Home Affairs. &ldquo;Once they are in our custody, their immigration status is reviewed. &ldquo;If the offender is a temporary resident, the visa will be withdrawn and the person will be required to leave South Africa.&rdquo;
