A MAN from Duncan Village in East London is too afraid to move into his family home. The electricity box outside the house has been taken over by izinyoka.Xola Menziwa (36) told Daily Sun that he and his cousins want to move into the house but it is too dangerous because of the live wires surrounding it. He said he had been complaining about the electricity box to the Buffalo City Municipality since 2008. Xola said at one point, he was even prepared to pay for the illegal connections to be removed. He said there were about five homes affected by the izinyoka. His situation is the worst because the electricity box is next to his front door. Vandals have also damaged the house because no one lives in it. &ldquo;I want this danger removed. I want people to know that I am the one reporting it,&rdquo; said Xola. Buffalo City spokesman Sibusisu Cindi said: &ldquo;The municipality&rsquo;s electricity raid team frequents this area on a regular basis and removes illegally installed electricity connections. The problem is that the community always make reconnections.&rdquo; He said he agreed that the homeowner had a valid safety concern. &ldquo;These unsafe conditions are unfortunately beyond our direct control, as the municipality doesn&rsquo;t provide authority for illegal connections to our network.&rdquo;
