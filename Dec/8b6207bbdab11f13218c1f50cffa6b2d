ROAD accidents in Mzansi kill more people than Aids.Pat Ngomane, the Mpumalanga MEC for community safety, security and liaison, said liquor outlets along roads contribute heavily to accidents.He was speaking at the launch of a road safety campaign ahead of the festive season in Tweefontein, near KwaMhlanga, on Saturday. He said the R573 Moloto Road is known as the road of death because of its many accidents, but people contribute to these accidents. &ldquo;People get drunk and walk on the road, and then cars knock them down,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This road is notorious for its accidents and there are contributing factors. &ldquo;People build shacks along the road to sell nyaope. There are also many taverns. &ldquo;When people are drunk they get into their cars and accidents are likely to happen.&rdquo;Ngomane said it was sad that so many young people, the future of the country, die on our roads. He urged residents to drink at home if they feel they must have alcohol. &ldquo;The police alone cannot fight and beat the problem. We need to work with them for our own safety.&rdquo; &ldquo;The safest place for young people is at home, school or church. They must just stay away from alcohol.&rdquo; Ngomane said traffic cops will be on duty 24 hours a day for the next few weeks. &ldquo;The cops will be visible on all the roads in the province. Many accidents also happen at night,&rdquo; he said. Thembisile Hani mayor Nomsa Mtsweni said people must make sure they drive roadworthy vehicles and follow the rules of the road. She said families bury their loved ones every weekend because of accidents. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Bethuel Zuma said next week the province will welcome 428 new cops who will help to boost the fight against crime.
