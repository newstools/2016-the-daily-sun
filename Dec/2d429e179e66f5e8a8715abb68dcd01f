AN EASTERN Cape sangoma said the kitten born with three legs is a gift from God and no harm should come to it. Sangoma Thandeka Fakela from Fakela Village, Mthatha said the kitten was just born with a disability. She said it would have had meaning if it was a sheep or a goat born with three legs. But Thandeka said the kitten should just be left to go about its life like a normal cat.Similo Ngxale (60), from Mdantsane, was confused when his cat gave birth to three kittens this month. Two of the cats were fine. The third was born with three legs. Similo said he was given different advice regarding the kitten. Some people told him it was good luck. Others said it was bad luck. Similo, who is a solid waste truck driver at Buffalo City Municipality, wanted to find out from SunReaders what the strange birth symbolised.Similo decided to give the other two kittens away. He left the one with three legs with its mother because he noticed that the cat liked it more than the others.Similo said life has been tough for him since June.
