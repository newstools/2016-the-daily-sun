THULI Madonsela was honoured with an award at the African ombudsman conference &ndash; but she was not invited to attend.This comes after new Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane threatened to ban and cancel the conference if her predecessor was invited to the event.City Press reported that Mkhwebane &ldquo;hates&rdquo; Madonsela so much that she threatened to withdraw South Africa&rsquo;s hosting of the African Ombudsman and Mediators&rsquo; Association.Mkhwebane reportedly told the secretariat that should Madonsela be invited, Mzansi will not host the event!As a result the organisation did not invite Madonsela, despite having honoured her at the event.The four-day conference was held last month in Durban.Madonsela&rsquo;s trophy and certificate were accepted on her behalf by deputy Public Protector Kevin Malunga.The newspaper also reported that Mkhwebane&rsquo;s threat to withdraw Mzansi from hosting the conference was contained in a heated string of emails from the Public Protector office&rsquo;s outgoing chief of staff, Bonginkosi Dhlamini, who was fired last week because his post did not match his expertise.According to an email which Dhlamini sent to Mkhwebane before he was kicked out, he said: &ldquo;I will ask Parliament whether it gave you a mandate to tell the association you will not host the conference if they invite your predecessor to receive an award she deserved.&rdquo;Madonsela&rsquo;s association colleagues from other countries were reportedly shocked as outgoing ombudsmen are not only invited but are also honoured at events which take place shortly after or before the end of their term. Dhlamini also accused Mkhwebane of having an issue with the State of Capture report and says that she is obsessed with Madonsela.
