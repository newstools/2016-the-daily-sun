BISHOP Robert Segoati claims to have the song which will help Bafana Bafana qualify and win the 2018 World Cup in Russia.The madala (57) from Hammanskraal, Tshwane said the song came to him in his sleep.&ldquo;I woke up and realised that God wanted to use me for a greater good.&rdquo; He said the song is titled Dinkgwete tsa rona, meaning, our champions. Robert said it was meant to be sung during the 2010 World Cup, but he did not have the right platform for the song to be heard by the country. He said he looked for choirs in Tshwane to sing it, but had no luck.&ldquo;The song has been in my heart since Bafana lost to Uruguay. Now it&rsquo;s time to make things right.&rdquo; Robert told the People&rsquo;s Paper the song is not meant for fame, but for the victory of the national team. &ldquo;This song is like a prayer for the team, so if the whole country could sing it at stadiums, there&rsquo;s a better chance that the team will bring the cup home in 2018.&rdquo; He said the suspension of Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba broke his heart.&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t be falling apart as we are getting ready for the World Cup in Russia. &ldquo;We are running out of time and there was no need to change coaches.&rdquo; According to Robert, he once had a dream about a song that helped find a resident who had been missing for over a week.&ldquo;God spoke to me and said if the church sang the song, the missing man would definitely come back home. &ldquo;The man was found the next day, although he was dead,&rdquo; Robert told Daily Sun.
