WHEN a tavern patroller started vomiting heavily, his friends immediately thought he had been poisoned. So they asked another patron, America Sithole, if he had given their friend beer.&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; screamed a boastful and happy America. Instead of offering him beer, as America had thought, the men allegedly dragged him outside and beat him. They allegedly fed him poison before setting him alight. His devastated friend, Vusi Lubisi (44), said the men had picked on America because he was an easy target.According to Vusi, America (50) was a well known drunk in the Kazibokwane area near Komatipoort, Mpumalanga, where he lived. &ldquo;They killed him just to prove a point that they can still kill someone. &ldquo;They knew America didn&rsquo;t make any sense when he was drunk,&rdquo; said Vusi. He said when America answered yes, he probably thought the men wanted to buy him beer. &ldquo;I am sure he was also trying to score points with the women. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t even know the man who was allegedly given poisoned beer,&rdquo; said Vusi.He said that he had tried to rescue America, but the men threatened to moer him. &ldquo;I had to watch as my friend was sjambokked and fed poison. He was then handed over to the crowd and they continued to beat him until he died. His body was then set alight.&rdquo;America&rsquo;s mum, gogo Salamina Mhlanga (79), said her son did not know what he was getting himself into when he claimed that he was the one who gave the other man beer. &ldquo;My son died for nothing,&rdquo; said the gogo.Salamina&rsquo;s friend, gogo Laurinda Khoza (70), said the pain the killers caused Salamina was beyond traumatic. &ldquo;Her son was not a killer,&rdquo; she said. The man who allegedly claimed to have been poisoned by America refused to talk to Daily Sun. Lieutenant Mzwandile Nyambi told the People&rsquo;s Paper that a case of murder has been opened and police were investigating.
