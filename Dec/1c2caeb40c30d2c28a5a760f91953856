HE HAD stolen once before and was burned with boiling water because of it, so Siphosethu Bucwa (19) changed his ways.But his criminal past stuck to him . . . And when the cellphone of the taxi driver he was collecting fares for went missing over the weekend, everyone accused Sipho-sethu of stealing it!He claims he begged his accusers to track the missing phone with its tracking app, but they allegedly refused and assaulted him instead. However, his suffering wasn&rsquo;t over yet.Later that same day, after the beating, Siphosethu, from KwaNobuhle in Uitenhage, was invited to a tavern by the driver. Then an unknown man arrived and allegedly poured boiling water all over him! &ldquo;I cried as other patrons looked on. I was rushed to Laetitia Bam Day Hospital where I was treated for burn injuries,&rdquo; said Sipho-sethu.&ldquo;I was doing my job on Saturday at the taxi rank at Uitenhage terminus when my driver complained about his missing cellphone.&ldquo;I told him another guy had come to sit in his taxi while he was sleeping. Another man arrived and sat with us.&ldquo;They left after chatting for a while. My driver then woke up and said his phone was missing. &ldquo;We looked for it and phoned it but it was on voicemail.&ldquo;It was a smartphone with a tracker,&rdquo; he said.But the taximen allegedly said: once a thief, always a thief.&ldquo;The driver&rsquo;s dad arrived with other drivers to search for the phone, but soon started kicking and punching me. They said I knew where the phone was, but when I asked them to use the tracker and search for it to prove my innocence, they simply refused and continued beating me, while my driver watched. &ldquo;Yes, I had stolen a phone before but this time I was innocent. As soon as I feel better I&rsquo;m going to lay charges against the men who assaulted me.&rdquo;Police spokeswoman Gerda Swart advised Sipho to open a criminal case at his nearest cop shop.
