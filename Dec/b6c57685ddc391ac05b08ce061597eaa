RESIDENTS of Mzamomhle in East London are seeing red. This is after houses they believed were theirs were allegedly handed over to other people. Now the residents want government to explain how the houses were awarded. A shack dweller in the area said she was excited when the houses were built last year. She was one of many residents who thought they would move into the houses.Sadly, this did not happen.However, she said only a few residents from the area were given houses.&ldquo;Whatever criteria were used to allocate these houses is wrong. When it rains, my shack leaks. My house has been given to someone else,&rdquo; said the resident. Another resident said they had waited for more than seven years to receive houses. &ldquo;When the time finally came for me to own a house, something fishy happened. Something is not right here. Even when I ask some of the new homeowners how they got their houses, they can&rsquo;t give me a clear answer,&rdquo; claimed the resident.Sibusiso Cindi, spokesman for Buffalo City Municipality, could not comment on the matter because it is a provincial project.Lwandile Sicwetsha, spokesman for the Eastern Cape Department of Human Settlements, said the they were aware of the issues raised by the residents.He added the department has started a programme which sees them travelling around the province to sort out such problems.&ldquo;The programme started in 2014 and we have helped some of the people get their houses back.&rdquo; Sicwetsha said sometimes the department battles to get hold of the beneficiaries and gives the house to someone else while searching for the rightful owner. He said: &ldquo;We ask the residents of Mzamomhle to wait because there is no place that we are not going to visit. The department believes if someone is the rightful owner of the house, they must get it. We will make sure that happens.&rdquo;
