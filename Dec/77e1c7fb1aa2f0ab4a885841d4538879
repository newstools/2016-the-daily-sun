MAMELODI Sundowns are the team to beat in the MultiChoice Diski Challenge this season.The Sundowns reserve team have conceded only four goals so far and go into the festive season recess sitting comfortably at the top of the table with 22 points. They are two points ahead of Bloemfontein Celtic in second place. On Sunday they had a great opportunity to extend their lead but failed to capitalise, as Chippa United ruined their seven-match winning streak when they held them to a 1-1 draw at Sisa Dukashe Stadium. The Young Brazilians coach David Notoane is happy with what they have achieved so far, but believes they could have done even better.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy that we are going into the Christmas break leading the standings. The players have shown character and hunger. We lost our first game of the season but they were not discouraged, they responded well after that.&rdquo; After nine games played, Notoane singled out striker Thabang Sibanyoni as one of the key players for Downs this season. The 19-year-old have scored seven goals in the MDC so far.&ldquo;The youngster has been a revelation for us this season. He only joined us late last season but now he is proving his worth,&rdquo; said Notoane.Celtic striker Tshegofatso Mabaso have been also doing well this season. Mabaso has eight goals to his name.Meanwhile, Baroka FC have also captured a record in the MDC. They have played nine games without collecting a single point and have the worst defence in the Diski League, having conceded 31 goals.
