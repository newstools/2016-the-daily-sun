ANDILE stood in his room with a rope around his neck, ready to end his life by kicking out the chair he was standing on.But he didn&rsquo;t do it.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m alive today because of Sfiso Ncwane&rsquo;s music. The song Kulungile Baba saved me,&rdquo; he told Daily Sun.&ldquo;I heard the song playing in the house next door. Tears rolled down my cheeks.&ldquo;When I heard the words baba kulungile makuyintando yakho, it was as if Sfiso was speaking to me.&ldquo;I listened to the song until it finished. &ldquo;I got off the chair and started praying.&rdquo;Andile Khuzwayo (30) from Meadowlands, Soweto told Daily Sun 2010 was the year when everything went wrong.He lost his job and his car.
