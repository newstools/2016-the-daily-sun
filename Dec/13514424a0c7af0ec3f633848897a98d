THIS FESTIVE season road show is going all out to warn people about crime! Last week, the Gauteng Department of Community Safety and the police went to Maponya Mall in Soweto to raise awareness about crimes that take place at this time of year.Cops and officials spoke to shoppers and taxi passengers and handed out pamphlets about how to keep safe. Gauteng community safety spokesman Thapelo Moiloa told Daily Sun: &ldquo;The festive season is a period with high volumes of crime, especially hijackings and robberies at malls, houses and more.&rdquo; He said sending plenty of police out to patrol places of entertainment, malls and highways is how they plan to control crime. &ldquo;Shoppers complained about Metro cops who search for bribes. We&rsquo;re committed to dealing with corruption. Since the beginning of the festive season, no crimes were reported, particularly mall robberies. This is attributed to the high visibility of police, community patrollers and Metro cops,&rdquo; said Moiloa.Lieutenant-Colonel Mack Mngomezulu said: &ldquo;We started at the Mall of Africa in Midrand and are moving forward. We are determined to work around the clock to end the lack of faith in the police.&rdquo; Ntsoaki Namane (54) from Klipspruit, Soweto applauded the initiative, saying the presence of men and women in blue makes residents feel safe.
