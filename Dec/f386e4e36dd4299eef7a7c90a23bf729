Golden Arrows winger Kudakwashe Mahachi insist that his focus is on ending the year on a positive note rather than the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations.Mahachi only recently returned to action from injury and aims to contribute to the team's objectives.The 23-year-old will be hoping to be called up by Zimbabwe for the continental competition set for January in Gabon but before that he insists his attentions are with his club.In their remaining matches, Arrows will face Wits on Wednesday, Baroka FC on December 18 and Kaizer Chiefs on December 21."I'm still coming from injury. I'm still behind when it comes to form and fitness. But I'm trying to get there." Mahachi told&nbsp;KickOff."But for now my mind is not entirely on making the AFCON squad. I will worry about that from the 22nd of December. Now I'm focusing on Golden Arrows, we want to win our last three games so we can get the nine points we are targeting."The games are coming thick and fast and that makes it difficult to maintain that form. It's up to us as senior players to guide and lead the youngsters."We are left with two games at home and the last one will be against Kaizer Chiefs so they must come in numbers to support us, so that when the league resumes again next year we find ourselves in a respectable position."
