THE fraudster pretended to be Premier Supra Mahumapelo. But now the fake North West leader is in jail! And the real Supra congratulated the Hawks on the arrest. Cops bust the suspect (25) on Saturday and he will appear in the Mmabatho Magistrates Court today. Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso said the Hawks bust the suspect in Kuruman, Northern Cape. &ldquo;The man allegedly impersonated the premier in an attempt to cheat people out of money.&rdquo;
