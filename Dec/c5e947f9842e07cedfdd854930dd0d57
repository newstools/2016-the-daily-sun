CAPE TOWN CITY winger, Lebogang Manyama, has warned his teammates to keep their feet firmly on the ground, if they are to lift the Telkom Knockout trophy on Saturday (6pm).Eric Tinkler&rsquo;s charges will meet SuperSport United in the final scheduled for Peter Mokaba Stadium, in Limpopo.The Cape Town side could make history by lifting the trophy hardly 165 days after being formed.City have had a fairytale run which also saw them beat Bidvest Wits 3-2 in their top of table Absa Premiership clash on Friday, to stretch their lead to four points.They have collected 24 points from 12 matches.Said Manyama: &ldquo;We are excited to be on top of the log for probably the whole weekend up until the final.&ldquo;But we have to remain humble because we&rsquo;ll face another strong side as you noticed what SuperSport are doing.&ldquo;They will also come very hard on us, but we&rsquo;re looking forward to that challenge.&rdquo;Added Manyama: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll plan for it, but now we&rsquo;ll relax and enjoy the moment until tomorrow when we start our preparations for the final.&rdquo;But the speedy player is unhappy with their performance despite scoring a brace against Wits.He went on: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we played one of our best games.&ldquo;But we fought for one another.&ldquo;You can see on the field that everyone keeps working hard.&ldquo;Before the game started I told my teammates that if we don&rsquo;t win, then we don&rsquo;t lose the game. &ldquo;We kept pilling pressure and they ended up doing something they don&rsquo;t normally do, opening up a lot of spaces.&ldquo;With the pace we have we knew we would catch them at some point.&rdquo;Wits coach Gavin Hunt said: &ldquo;To be fair, we should have won the game comfortably.&ldquo;They broke out and scored, I&rsquo;m very disappointed to have lost like that and concede two games in a row now.&rdquo;
