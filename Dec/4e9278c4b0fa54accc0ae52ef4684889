MANY lives have been lost on this road.So, priests, church members and the community of Lethabong near Rustenburg, North West travelled along the road last week, stopping every now and then to pray for a safer road. The prayer day started at the busy intersection where roads from Rustenburg, Brits and Pretoria join the R556 to Sun City. It seems that death visits this road all the time, especially the dangerous 15km stretch from Rustenburg to Lethabong.The road is used by trucks and other vehicles travelling between North West and Limpopo or Gauteng. Some people died after cars hit animals on the road and overturned.Cars have been reported to have gone crashing through fences and into trees. When accidents happen people lose breadwinners, parents and guardians. Death leads to orphans and to more poverty as families are left to fend for themselves.With the festive season coming and people drinking so much, the community decided to ask for God&rsquo;s intervention to stop road deaths. Priests from different churches were dressed in their church regalia for the day.Resident Frans Mogale said: &ldquo;We prayed for safety on all roads across the country.&rdquo;
