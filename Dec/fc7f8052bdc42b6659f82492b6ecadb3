&ldquo;VULTURES lurk in the darkness and want to snatch my Khosi!&rdquo;This is according to Sivuyile Tutu (25), whose 4-5 was bitten at a tavern two weeks ago by his sweetheart, Khosi Makeleni (32). After the incident, Daily Sun published an article about it. At the time, Sivuyile said they had broken up but they recently got back together. The couple has been together for two years and was spotted staggering out of the tavern in Sigila Street in KwaNobuhle, Nelson Mandela Bay, on Monday afternoon. Sivuyile said: &ldquo;We talked about the issue of my 4-5 and it&rsquo;s over now. Khosi said she was angry when she bit my 4-5 and I understood. &ldquo;My 4-5 has since healed and it&rsquo;s working again. There is only a tooth mark on it now. &ldquo;It took us four days to get back together again. We booze together, joke together and no one can come between us.&rdquo; The jikeleza driver said he and Khosi beat the odds as most people said they could never reconcile. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t live without me and I can&rsquo;t be without her. After I said I was done with Khosi, I soon realised I had made a big mistake.&ldquo;She is my future, my sweetheart and whoever tried to be a vulture and wanted to snatch her away from me must forget it. We live together and we will die together. &ldquo;Yes, Khosi mauled my 4-5 in front of boozers in a tavern but I&rsquo;ve forgiven her. Every man here took advantage of my decision and wanted to take her from me but my affair with Khosi is not yet over.&rdquo;
