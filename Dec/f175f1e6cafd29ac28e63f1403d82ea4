AN ACT of kindness led to Hendrick Makaneta, Higher Education transformation network spokesman, being robbed. The 41-year-old was robbed at home after picking up two young girls he said he felt sorry for at a shisa nyama in Atteridgeville, Tshwane, almost three weeks ago. &ldquo;They approached me and asked me for a lift home. They said they lived in West Park, which is not far from where I live.&rdquo;Hendrick told Daily Sun when they arrived where the girls claimed to live, they couldn&rsquo;t find their keys in their handbags. &ldquo;They claimed to have lost them and asked me to accommodate them for the night. They looked young and frightened and I felt sorry for them so I decided to take them home with me.&rdquo; Hendrick said they stopped in Centurion to buy food and drinks before going to his house. &ldquo;We ate and drank at my house. I then fell into a deep sleep.&rdquo; According to Hendrick, he felt weak and dizzy when he woke up the next day. &ldquo;I looked for my cellphone and it was gone. I then realised the girls had also disappeared.&rdquo;He said they took his laptop and his wallet, which had R500 inside. A while later, the girls withdrew R150 from his bank account. He went to the police to open a case. Captain David Miller, Lyttelton police spokesman, said a case of theft was being investigated. &ldquo;People should always keep an eye on their drinks when with strangers. They shouldn&rsquo;t just let anyone they meet at a bar into their homes.&rdquo;
