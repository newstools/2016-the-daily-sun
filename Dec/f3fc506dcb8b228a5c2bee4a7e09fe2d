KEBBY Maphatsoe has extended an olive branch to all factions in the ANC, especially former MK soldiers.&ldquo;I apologise to other stalwarts for calling them empty tins. I think I went overboard with my comments,&rdquo; the MK Military Veterans Association chairman said. Maphatsoe was speaking at Luthuli House in Joburg yesterday about the MK Awards to be held at Emperors Palace in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni, tomorrow. He said the veterans association respected the decision taken by the ANC NEC that media spats needed to end. &ldquo;Our public spats happen because of ill discipline. We should be sitting here in the office sorting out our issues politely without running to the media.&rdquo; Maphatsoe said there was no bad blood between him and other military veterans.&ldquo;We call upon all former combatants of the people&rsquo;s army to set aside their organisational differences and strive for unity, which is important for the ANC.&rdquo; Maphatsoe said the awards would be handed out by President Jacob Zuma. They will honour 31 former MK members. He said special recognition would be given to Brian Molefe, Dudu Myeni and Hlaudi Motsoeneng for their work in bringing transformation in their fields. &ldquo;You must forget about politics when you look at the contributions of people like Hlaudi. These awards were planned over a period of time.&rdquo;
