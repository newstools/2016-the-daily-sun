Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela says he has to take the backlash that is coming his way, following calls by the Amakhosi fans for a change in management.&nbsp;The Soweto giants occupy seventh spot in the Premiership table and their dismal form in the Premiership - six consecutive&nbsp; games without victory - has resulted in the Chiefs fraternity calling for Komphela's head and the former Maritzburg United mentor needing to be escorted off the pitch by stadium security."Sometimes when I go through pressure and hell&sbquo; it is about who do I represent&sbquo;" he told TMG Digital.&nbsp;"Sometimes you have to take fire not because you deserve to be burnt&sbquo; you take fire on behalf of (the club)."And when you suffer on behalf of (the club) you suffer with pleasure."&nbsp;Chiefs welcome Bloemfontein Celtic to the FNB Stadium on Wednesday, and Komphela feels that a hostile atmosphere could work against his side."Sometimes it works against you when you are playing at home and your people are not happy and they are edgy," Komphela added. "It becomes a tense match."
