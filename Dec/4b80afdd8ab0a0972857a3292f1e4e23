KASI people were excited about the project. Just before the local government elections, a massive R9 million was announced for a stormwater drain to be built at Maboloka, near Brits in North West. Boards announced the project, trucks arrived, workers dug a trench and started casting concrete slabs &ndash; right up until the elections. That&rsquo;s when the workers disappeared, and so did the contractor.The money came from the municipal infrastructure grant. Residents were told that workers were not paid and the money in the grant had run out. Concerned residents told Daily Sun that if it rains, kids struggle to get to school. They have to cross the big trench. They say that kids swim in the flooded hole left by the abandoned project. As for the elderly, they don&rsquo;t try to cross over, but just take the long way round. The kasi people say it&rsquo;s wrong for a contractor to be paid just to dig such a long, deep trench that only makes lives harder. The People&rsquo;s Paper asked Madibeng municipal spokesman, Tumelo Tshabalala, what had happened. He said: &ldquo;The municipality appointed a contractor for the construction of a stormwater channel but unfortunately his performance was poor. &ldquo;That resulted in the termination of the contract. Procurement of a new contractor is underway and will be finalised early in January.&rdquo;
