THERE will be tears of joy and sadness when the matric results are released on 5 January. Those who don&rsquo;t pass have another chance though!The Second Chance Matric Programme, presented by the Department of Education, will give those who did not pass an opportunity to rewrite and improve their results for a national senior certificate. To qualify you must have failed at least two subjects. The supplementary exams are written in February and March of every year.Those who qualify can often get extra classes to prepare from January until they write exams.Some matrics who have been through the programme told SunEducation they were happy as in the end they were able to catch up with their peers.&ldquo;I registered for university in June to pursue my tertiary studies after I received my matric results in May.&ldquo;That meant I was back on the same path with my friends who left me behind,&rdquo; said Nthabiseng Mofokeng.Some of the support offered to matrics by the department include:- Face to face tuition in every province.- Sound system equipment will be available at various schools and venues for lessons.- Printed resources such as Mind the Gap study guides, past exam question papers and textbooks are available, but only in the pilot districts. The printed material will be implemented for both supplementary and progressed pupils.- Candidates will be able to access the internet and other online resources at teacher centres, Vodacom centres, libraries and free wi-fi hotspots.
