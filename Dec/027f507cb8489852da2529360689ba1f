TSHWANE cops launched their 16 days of activism for no violence against women and children campaign on Wednesday.They said the campaign, which they named Back To Basics, aims to create awareness about abuse.Hundreds of officers marched from the Union Buildings to Church Square, encouraging abuse victims to speak out.Colonel Refilwe Matlamela said most victims are too afraid to report abuse because of the way they are treated by police.&ldquo;Cops need to stop telling abused women to go back home and fix the matter with their husbands or partners.&rdquo; She said many women died at the hands of their abusers because they were turned away by the police.Colonel Thomas Motjila said victims must report abuse as soon as possible.&ldquo;If someone lays their hands on you, report them and stop seeing them. &ldquo;If you remain in an abusive relationship, that person won&rsquo;t stop abusing you until you are dead,&rdquo; he said.Lieutenant-General Sharon Jephta urged cops to be open to the public, especially those who have been abused.She said if the police played their role properly, fewer people would die as a result of domestic violence.&ldquo;We need to make sure no more women in our country are killed because of their sexual orientation.&rdquo;
