Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa's friends love the new government max condoms, he said at the commemoration of World Aids Day in Sinaba Stadium in Daveyton.&nbsp; "Today when my friends see me they always extend their arm and I always have condoms to give out," he said. A jovial Ramaphosa spoke highly of sex saying that it was, "probably one of the greatest experiences", but encouraged the youth to wait for the right moment to indulge in sex.&nbsp; "I often tell young young people that sex is such a wonderful experience, probably one of the greatest experiences, but even greater when you wait for it to come at the right moment, then it is much more enjoyable."&nbsp; He encouraged parents to talk about sex with their children saying that he has had several conversations with his 19-year-old on the subject.&nbsp; "Gone are the days when parents must just whisper about sex. Parents must talk about sex everywhere they are. I have a 19-year-old, he just asks me embarrassing questions about sex. He listens to me about sexuality... We talk about condoms and all that."He then poked fun at Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi saying that he was the one who brought it to government's attention that the old Choice condoms were noisy."He was somehow told the old condoms are noisy. He knew more about the noisiness of condoms. When we were in Durban he rolled them out and we started distributing them, now you find these condoms all over," Ramaphosa joked.Ramaphosa added that the condoms were a great hit in Parliament.In September Ramaphosa urged Members of Parliament to help themselves to the new government condoms - designed for maximum pleasure and to limit the noise.Answering questions in the National Assembly, the deputy president lauded the new condoms, which were introduced in June.They were aimed at increasing prevention in the country, Ramaphosa said.&nbsp;News24 Source http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/my-friends-use-the-new-max-condoms-ramaphosa-20161201
