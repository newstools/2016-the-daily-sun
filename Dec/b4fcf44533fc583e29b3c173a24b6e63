SUPERSPORT United star players Reneilwe &ldquo;Yeye&rdquo; Letsholonyane and captain Dean Furman were visibly disappointed and blamed themselves for their loss to Cape Town City on Saturday. United conceded the goal that killed them immediately after getting back into the match following Kingston Nkhatha&rsquo;s equaliser. They allowed CT City to regain the lead barely two minutes later and Matsatsantsa a Pitori were never able to recover. &ldquo;We let ourselves down. We scored a goal and got a little excited. A minute later all our hard work of 45 minutes was undone,&rdquo; said Furman. &ldquo;We have to improve on that. We had worked so hard to get back into the game.&ldquo;The season is not over. We are all disappointed and hurting a bit, but there&rsquo;s still a long way to go. We are in a good position in the league and hope for a strong finish &ndash; and there&rsquo;s also the Nedbank Cup to challenge for. So we just have to pick ourselves up quickly,&rdquo; he added. Letsholonyane had a fantastic game but was shattered by the outcome: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point of having a good game and losing? We conceded the second goal in a critical phase, after scoring. The coach always reminds us to concentrate in critical moments and we all let the team down. We made a mistake and they punished us. Congratulations to City, they&rsquo;re a very good team.&rdquo;
