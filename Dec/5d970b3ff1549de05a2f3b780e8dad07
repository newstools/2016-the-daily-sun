FOUR initiates have died in the Eastern Cape as provincial government ropes in law enforcement officials to tackle illegal initiation schools in the province.Over the past seven days, four initiates were found dead. One was from Mthatha, another from Mbizana, and the other two were from Linge and Tsomo in the Chris Hani region.Mamnkeli Ngam, spokesman for traditional affairs MEC Fikile Xasa, said the body of the Mthatha initiate was dumped in the Enkululekweni area.The initiate from Tsomo allegedly collapsed and died in a pit toilet. Police are investigating whether the school was licenced.Traditional affairs MEC Fikile Xasa spoke about the deaths yesterday at Nyandeni Great Place in Libode, near Mthatha.Xasa said he was concerned by the deaths as massive efforts were made to talk to communities and chiefs about the safety of initiates. &ldquo;We are hoping for a big change in how the law deals with illegal surgeons, especially after the Eastern Cape Customary Male Initiation Practice Bill of 2015 was passed last week. &ldquo;We are just waiting for Premier Phumulo Masualle to sign the bill so it can become law,&rdquo; he said.According to the new bill, the owners of initiation schools can face up to one year behind bars if the school is found to be operating illegally. The owners could also spend 25 years in prison if an initiate dies in their care.Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mzukisi Fatyela said an inquest case has been opened after the death of the 19- year-old initiate from Mthatha. &ldquo;It appears he may have died from dehydration.&rdquo;
