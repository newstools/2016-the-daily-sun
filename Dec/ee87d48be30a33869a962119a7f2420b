THE blood of a goat is needed to cleanse the spot where death robbed an initiate of his life.A ritual will soon be held at the ibhoma where messengers found Luphelo Madala (19) dead on Monday.The sacrificial animal will be provided by Nelson Mandela Bay&rsquo;s isiXhosa-speaking mayor, Athol Trollip.Elders said Luphelo, a grade 11 pupil from Nkululeko High School was ready to go home when death struck.&ldquo;Luphelo had already healed from his circumcision and the ukojiswa ceremony was held two days beforehand,&rdquo; chief Solly Dondashe told Daily Sun.The death of the initiate from Holomisa kasi in Uitenhage shocked people around the province. The chief said the goat will be slaughtered after Luphelo had been buried and its blood sprinkled at the place where he died. &ldquo;We are removing this curse. We want to keep our record of zero initiation deaths in this region.&ldquo;We have spoken to the family and they agreed. Trollip will donate the goat. We learned this culture from our ancestors so that there will be no more deaths.&ldquo;The initiate&rsquo;s death isn&rsquo;t related to circumcision as he was healed and ready to go home,&rdquo; said Dondashe.&ldquo;In future, we will only permit winter circumcisions here. We hope to buy two small farms in the Uitenhage area where we want to build a hospital that can deal with injured initiates.&ldquo;We will also train iingcibi and amakhankatha.&rdquo;Trollip said the traditional leaders asked the metro to donate a goat. &ldquo;I spoke to deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani and he agreed we will help. It is for a good cause. I also like their idea of a hospital for abakhwetha.&rdquo;The initiate&rsquo;s grandfather, Danile Madala (78), thanked Trollip. &ldquo;When my grandson died, we were shocked because he was healthy. My daughter Noluthando (49) has lost her only son. We welcome this cleansing,&rdquo; he said.
