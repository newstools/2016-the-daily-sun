A rapist cut himself in the neck shortly before he was due to be sentenced in the High Court in Bloemfontein yesterday.&nbsp;About three hours later, Elton Daddy Bell, 32, was back in court, his neck bandaged. He walked into court with a cheeky: "Here I am again. I&rsquo;m back," Netwerk24 reported.&nbsp;On his second visit to the court, several heavily-armed correctional services officials accompanied him. The book in which he had apparently hidden the blade he had used, was nowhere to be seen.&nbsp;Judge Martha Mbhele said the court was not there to be fooled around in. She warned him she would not put up with nonsense. &nbsp;Sentencing was postponed to Friday. He was previously found guilty of housebreaking with the intent to rape, and rape, two counts of robbery with aggravating circumstances, and a charge of housebreaking with the intent to rob.&nbsp;The drama started when Bell said he wasn&rsquo;t satisfied with his Legal Aid lawyer, Similo Kambi. He raised his objections just before the lunch break and Kambi&rsquo;s mandate was terminated. &nbsp;Mbhele explained it was too late to have a new lawyer appointed for him.Bell wouldn&rsquo;t listen. When Mbhele ordered him to sit down so she could proceed, he refused: "No, I don&rsquo;t want to sit."Two prison warders forced him to sit.&nbsp;Bell said he didn&rsquo;t want to listen to the sentencing. Mbhele had just begun reading it, when there was a stream of blood. The warders wrestled the blade away him. Bell fell and then sat banging his head against a wall.&nbsp;An ambulance was called and he was taken to Pelonomi Hospital.&nbsp;
