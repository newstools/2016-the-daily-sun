ON SUNDAY, Thoko Shozi discovered that her husband&rsquo;s tombstone had been erected on the wrong grave!The 60-year-old from Klaarwater, west of Durban, told Daily Sun: &ldquo;When the installers showed us the photo of the completed work, my children pointed out that the tombstone might have been erected on the wrong grave.&rdquo;She said they went to her husband&rsquo;s grave in Queensburgh Cemetery the next day, and found the grave still had no tombstone.She blames eThekwini Municipality for swapping grave numbers, but municipal officials say it was her fault.The service provider told her that if she wanted to put a tombstone on her husband&rsquo;s grave, she would have to buy another one because the gravestone would be damaged if moved.Sboniso Sikhosana of Abasha Funeral Home said: &ldquo;We installed the tombstone on the grave as per the number we were given.&rdquo; Thoko said: &ldquo;eThekwini Municipality told me I should have gone with the installers so that I could have discovered at an early stage that the grave numbers had been swapped! &ldquo;Despite this ordeal the unveiling ceremony will continue on Saturday. I&rsquo;ve already paid for the cow, goat, food and I&rsquo;ve invited people.&rdquo; Thembinkosi Ngcobo, head of the municipality&rsquo;s parks, recreation and culture unit, said they would investigate. &ldquo;We always urge family members to accompany service providers to avoid such mistakes,&rdquo; Ngcobo said.
