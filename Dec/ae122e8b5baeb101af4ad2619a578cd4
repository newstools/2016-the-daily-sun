FAMILY, friends and classmates said an emotional goodbye on Saturday to grade 2 pupil Petrus Shoka (7), found murdered two weeks ago.The bodies of Petrus and his friend, Samuel Ngobeni (10), were found floating in a stream among bushes. Their families had opened missing person cases four days after they went missing on 28 November.It is suspected they were killed for their body parts: Three sangomas were arrested after the bodies were found.Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed, however, that further investigation had led to the release of two of the sangomas.One sangoma will be appearing in court today. It is still uncertain when Samuel will be buried as his mum was admitted to Lebowakgomo Hospital after being injured in a &ldquo;mob justice&rdquo; attack, while his father is still at large.Grieving dad John Shoka (44) said: &ldquo;It has been a difficult week for my family. It is still hard for my wife to cope. &ldquo;This has torn us apart. We never thought our neighbours could do such evil to these children. &ldquo;At least we have buried my boy and now we can focus on this case. &ldquo;As parents we were looking forward to raising him well, so he could realise his future. He was so clever, very caring to his friends and respectful. &ldquo;We are praying to God to give us the strength to survive this. &ldquo;But we are looking forward to the law of this country punishing these cruel murderers.&rdquo; Chuene royal family secretary Bernard Molomo said the murder of the boys had left the community in pain.He said they would hold a mass meeting with residents to decide whether those responsible for the death of the innocent boys should be chased away from the village or not.
