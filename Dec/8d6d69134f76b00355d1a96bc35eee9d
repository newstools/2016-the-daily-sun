AT midnight tomorrow, the night sky of Mzansi will rain fire and burst into loud bangs. That&rsquo;s how some people celebrate New Year.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s a dark side to the use of fireworks. Terrified pets will hide under beds. And unless safety precautions are taken, a happy evening can end in tears and tragedy. That&rsquo;s why Joburg police officers were out raiding local fireworks retailers yesterday, helped by the Emergency Management Services (EMS).&nbsp; Robert Mulaudzi, EMS spokesman, said the operation was to make sure that no one would be injured by fireworks. &ldquo;We urge people selling fireworks to comply with regulations, which they should have done long before now. &ldquo;We want to make sure that the dealers of fireworks comply with the regulations. The reason for the raids is to ensure that we don&rsquo;t have any fires during the New Year and that people and animals will be safe.&rdquo; The raids covered Bruma, the Oriental Plaza shopping centre and various retail outlets in the city centre.&nbsp; The special unit confiscated a few boxes of mixed fireworks, each costing R5 000, in a number of stores. The operation will continue until tomorrow. Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar, JMPD spokesman, said: &ldquo;Dealers who sell fireworks without a permit will have to pay a fine of R2 600 to get out of the cop shop.&rdquo; Fireworks will only be permitted on New Year&rsquo;s Eve from 11pm till 1am.
