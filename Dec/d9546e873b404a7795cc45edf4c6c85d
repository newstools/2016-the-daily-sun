JULIUS Malema compared Fidel Castro to Nelson Mandela. And then he compared President Jacob Zuma to Fulgencio Batista, the Cuban dictator who was overthrown by Castro in 1959.Speaking at a memorial service for Castro hosted by the EFF, Malema said: &ldquo;Zuma is the Batista of our time. We must crush him like Fidel defeated Batista. We are the Fidels of the 21st century.&rdquo;The service was held at a packed hall in Protea South, Soweto.Malema said it was surprising that the ANC chose to commemorate Castro while it had failed its own people.&ldquo;If the ANC had the same commitment as Fidel, they would not have denied students free education. Students in Cuba are learning for free,&rdquo; Malema said.He told the mourners the only way to honour Castro was to take the land back from whites.Yesterday Cubans were observing the fifth of nine days of mourning for Castro, following his death on Friday aged 90. Castro&rsquo;s ashes were taken to be symbolically re-united with that of his fallen comrade in arms, Che Guevara, in Santa Clara, Cuba.
