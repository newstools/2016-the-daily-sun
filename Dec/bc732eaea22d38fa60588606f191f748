They talk to kids and then take their phones and cash.Kate Moshitwa (35) from Naledi said she has heard of the dikhorane but never thought her child would be a victim.&ldquo;On Wednesday I went to the shops and when I came back, my 12-year-old was crying. She told me she had been robbed of her cellphone and mine as well,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I knew the dikhorane had struck.&rdquo; She said the two women came up to her daughter and her friends near a local orphanage. &ldquo;They asked for their cellphones to put stickers on that showed they supported orphans. They got into the car, pretending to take out the stickers and then fled with the phones.&rdquo; Sibongile Mosia (29) said her nephew was robbed near a primary school. She said according to the boy, who is 15, they said they were social workers. &ldquo;They even showed him name badges to prove it.&rdquo; The women said their phone battery was dead and took his phone. &ldquo;They sat down in a car pretending to phone, but then they raced off.&ldquo;Most people have heard about dikhorane, yet they keep robbing people. I think they use strong muthi to make young people agree to everything they say.&rdquo;Captain Johannes Maheso of Mamelodi West police urged those who have been robbed to open cases at the police station.
