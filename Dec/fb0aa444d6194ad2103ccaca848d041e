ALL these residents want is for the cops to arrest the criminals who terrorise them. On Friday, the people of Boitumelo, Golden Gardens and Sebokeng Hostel marched to Sebokeng Police Station in the Vaal to hand over a memorandum of their demands. They called for an end to gang violence and other criminal activities linked to initiation schools. Residents of different areas of the Vaal said they decided to come together because thugs were moving from area to area committing crimes.Residents demanded that police arrest criminals, that they stop escorting gangsters carrying dangerous weapons, that one of the police sector managers be removed for failing to do his duties, and that prosecutors work with police to make sure criminals are convicted. The march started in Boitumelo before making its way to the cop shop, where residents gathered in large numbers. Addressing the marchers, Councillor Mthuzimele Sikukula said residents needed to work with the police to fight crime. &ldquo;Now that the schools have closed and workers are on holiday, the police must work with us to prevent housebreakings,&rdquo; he said. Councillor Bheki Ntsele said they were not only focusing on putting an end to gangsterism, but on stopping all crime. &ldquo;This is the police station we must support to stop gangsterism. &ldquo;These criminals are moving around the area and together with the police we must stop them from robbing us of our cellphones and breaking into our homes.&rdquo; The memorandum was received by station commander Brigadier Selikoe Mokoena. He was given 14 days to respond to the residents&rsquo; concerns.
