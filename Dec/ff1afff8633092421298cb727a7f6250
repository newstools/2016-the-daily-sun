HIGHLANDS Park coach Gordon Igesund is targeting nine points before the Premier Soccer League goes into the Christmas break.He also intends to beef up his squad in the January transfer window.The PSL rookies are under immense pressure as they try to get out of the relegation zone before the second round starts next February. They sit at the bottom of the Absa Premiership table with eight points after 11 games and will endeavour to beat Bloemfontein Celtic in their postponed league match at Makhulong Stadium on Wednesday (7:30pm).Igesund has not won a single match in the league since he took charge of Highlands on 18 October.His side has collected five points out of a possible 18 since he replaced Allan Freese. After their clash with Phunya Sele Sele the Lions of the North will play Ajax Cape Town, Chippa United and Platinum Stars before the break. All those teams are struggling in the league too and will not make matters easy for under-pressure Igesund. The former SuperSport United and Bafana Bafana mentor reckons his 2-2 draw with Orlando Pirates at Orlando Stadium on Saturday will help his boys gain confidence as they prepare for the tough matches ahead. Igesund said: &ldquo;Against Pirates we played good football and knocked the ball around. This will definitely improve player confidence. Take away the match against Mamelodi Sundowns which we lost 5-0 (last weekend) and we have done well. I believe the wins will come.&ldquo;We have played Arrows, Sundowns and now Pirates, the players are slowly adjusting but I&rsquo;m happy with their response.&rdquo;Igesund said he would bolster his squad when the January transfer window opens in order to achieve his goal of keeping the team in the elite league next season.He said: &ldquo;The January break is coming and I&rsquo;m not looking to replace the players that got us promoted, but we have to beef up the team. We will be looking to strengthen the squad, as I am sure other teams will be doing too.&rdquo;
