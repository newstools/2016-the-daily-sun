WHEN she sees the rain clouds gathering, she starts shaking with fear. Lindiwe Nhlapho (58), from Graceland in Ekurhuleni, lives in a house built on a swamp. Her house has started cracking and she is worried it might one day fall in on her. Lindiwe&rsquo;s house is surrounded by reeds and when it rains, her yard is flooded with muddy water.&ldquo;I moved here in 2004. I didn&rsquo;t care where I was placed because I needed a place to live. But my problems started in 2011,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;My furniture was damaged and my house is a mess. I spoke to the municipality and the councillor, but nothing has happened. In 2011 they promised to move me, but nothing happened,&rdquo; said Lindiwe.Community leader Stringo Dhlamini (44) said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m angry because in 2011 when the ANC was campaigning, some party leaders promised to get Lindiwe a safer place. This has given me a bad name because now it seems I just wanted to get votes for my party.&rdquo;Themba Radebe, spokesman for the City of Ekurhuleni, said: &ldquo;We have identified alternative house for the lady to move to temporarily. We are negotiating with the province to deregister that house because it should not have been approved in the first place. We will then transfer the lady&rsquo;s subsidy to a new house and demolish the current house.&ldquo;There are two properties that have been identidied. She went to view them but she had an issue of proximity to her work place. We will continue looking for alternative places.&rdquo;
