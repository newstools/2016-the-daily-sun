The Provincial Media Centre of the Eastern Cape issued a media statement on 9 December 2016 relating to the arrest of a 43-year-old pastor for the rape of a 18-year-old woman near Msobomvu, Dutywa. &nbsp; It was reported that the suspect (pastor) was affiliated to the Zion Christian Church (ZCC). At the time of the reporting of the matter, the SAPS was of the impression that our facts were correct. It has since been brought to our attention that the suspect was not a pastor of the ZCC Church. &nbsp; The SAPS wishes to render our sincere apology for this misconception which might have caused embarrassment to the leadership and members of the ZCC in South Africa in particular to His Grace, the Right Reverend Bishop, Dr Barnabas Lekganyane. &nbsp; The SAPS regret the incorrect reference made&nbsp; to the religious affiliation of the suspect in this case but reiterates that any person no matter his or her&nbsp;&nbsp; standing in the community or religious connotation, will be dealt with according to the law, when accused of such crimes. &nbsp; &nbsp;The&nbsp; mistake is&nbsp; highly regretted and it is requested that our sincere apologies be accepted as there was no malicious intent. &nbsp;
