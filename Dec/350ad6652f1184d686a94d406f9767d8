MPHO Banda rented her house out but she did not know the tenants were scammers!This week Mpho almost lost her house when angry residents wanted to set it alight. They said her tenants were fake ancestors!According to Mpho (33) from Diepkloof in Soweto she went to collect rent money at the house on Sunday after the tenants had been giving her the runaround. She said: &ldquo;I normally get the rent money in my bank account, so when that did not happen I went there &ndash; but there was no one. &ldquo;The house was locked, and while I was busy checking the yard, a group of angry people confronted me. They thought I was one of the scammers. They told me that the tenants were pretending to be sangomas.&rdquo;On Monday, Mpho went back to the house and kicked open the door. She found the house in a terrible state. She said: &ldquo;It was smelly and there was muthi everywhere. In one of the bedrooms there was a place that seemed like an indumba. There was a cloth creating a small room. I think this is where one of these people would sit and pretend to be an ancestor while the other acted like an inyanga,&rdquo; she said.Neighbours said strange things happened at the house. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen people coming to consult, only to later find they&rsquo;ve been robbed of their valuables,&rdquo; said a neighbour.Another neighbour alleged the fake sangomas went as far as sleeping with women clients.
