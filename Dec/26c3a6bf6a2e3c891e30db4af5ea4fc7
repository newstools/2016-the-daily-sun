ZANDILE Sangweni publicly opposed the nomination of Nokufika Biyela as a councillor, and now Zandile believes she&rsquo;s getting revenge. Zandile told Daily Sun Biyela ended up winning the local government election and now she&rsquo;s refusing to hand over the keys to ZAndile&rsquo;sRDP house. The 44-year-old from Lindelani, north of Durban claimed Biyela was punishing her. Zandile said former Councillor Mbuyiselwa Sibiya chose her to receive an RDP. She said after Biyela won the election she took the keys to all the RDPs from community liaison officer, Thulasizwe Gumede. Gumede confirmed this. &ldquo;Councillor Biyela said she won&rsquo;t give me the keys because she&rsquo;s investigating alleged corruption involving the RDPs. But I have all the documents to prove I&rsquo;m the rightful owner,&rdquo; claimed Zandile. She showed the documents to the SunTeam, which were signed by the former councillor and state she had been allocated RDP house number C1494. Biyela said Zandile&rsquo;s case was still being investigated. &ldquo;We found out she owns 15 rooms, which she rents out. This disqualifies her from owning an RDP. We&rsquo;re trying to find out how she qualified in the first place,&rdquo; said Biyela. She denied victimising Zandile. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not the only one who hasn&rsquo;t received her keys. None of the RDPs have been occupied as the investigation is still continuing,&rdquo; she said. Zandile denied renting out rooms. Former councillor, Mbuyiselwa Sibiya said all the RDP beneficiaries, including Zandile, qualified but he wouldn&rsquo;t comment further.
