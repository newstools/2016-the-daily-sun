Former Springbok captain Francois Pienaar believes that the Springboks should be the best team in world rugby.&nbsp;Pienaar, who led the Boks to Rugby World Cup glory in 1995, said this week at a Varsity Cup event that the talent was available for South Africa."It's incredibly disappointing. We should rule the world. That's my feeling," Pienaar said."We have the talent in this country to do that."If you look at the effect if our sports teams do not do well ... it has a massive effect on everybody because in this country we love our sport and we want our teams to be the best, week in and week out."Pienaar pointed to October's coaching indaba and hoped things would get back on track, but he did suggest that there would have to be some kind of change that takes place moving forward."There's a different thinking necessary, definitely, for us to become the best in the world," he said.
