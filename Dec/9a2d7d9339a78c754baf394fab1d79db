COPS must arrest the people who are behind the killings in the village, or the residents will take the law into their own hands!This is the message residents of Zola extension, outside Thulamahashe in Mpumalanga, gave to the cops and the court last week. They wanted the Mhala Magistrates Court to release the 16 people who had been arrested for public violence and malicious damage to property.The suspects, aged between 20 and 33, were arrested after they burnt two cars and damaged the house of a man they suspected of being behind the murder of Matimba Mathebula (17).Matimba was shot dead after a pen&rsquo;s down celebration on 26 November. The cars and the house were attacked shortly after Matimba&rsquo;s funeral on Saturday. The residents claim cops have been dragging their feet about arresting the killers, but were quick to bust innocent residents. Another murder case the residents are complaining about is that of gogo Ania Makhubele (80), who was found hacked to pieces in her house on 25 November.Surprise Ngwenya (41) said the residents will not rest until the killers are bust. &ldquo;People are slaughtered like cows in our village.

We will continue to fight crime our own way.&rdquo;Constable Sonile Usinga said the 16 people were released on warning.She added that investigations into the other cases were continuing.
