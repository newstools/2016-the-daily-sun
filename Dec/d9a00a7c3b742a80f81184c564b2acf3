TWO men have been arrested for allegedly hijacking a truck with stock worth over half a million rand. The hijacking took place yesterday morning on the R50 in Bapsfontein, Ekurhuleni while the truck was on its way to deliver goods worth R700 000 to a popular store. Thanks to a joint operation between the Ekurhuleni Metro police horse unit and the vehicle tracking company, Rentrak, the truck was located. Swift police action led to the recovery of the goods and the arrest of two suspects. After receiving a tip-off, the Metro cops jumped into action and tracked the truck&rsquo;s movements on the R50 until it got on to the Nellmapius on-ramp in Tshwane, where it was cornered and the suspects were bust. The vehicle tracking company first suspected something was wrong when the truck&rsquo;s signal was disrupted and it suddenly took a non-planned route.A signal jammer device was found in the hijacked vehicle. The driver of the hijacked truck was dumped in Tembisa and a manhunt is currently underway for another four suspects and two vehicles believed to have been involved in the crime. Two suspects, aged 31 and 38, were charged with possession of a hijacked truck. The driver also laid a charge of hijacking. The suspects are expected to appear in court soon.
