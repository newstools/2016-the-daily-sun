AFTER ending the first round of the Absa Premiership positively, Golden Arrows head coach Clinton Larsen now feels his team will get better with at least four new recruits. During the off season, Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende brought in six new players and they also signed former Bafana Bafana and Cardiff City ace Kagisho Dikgacoi, who was a free agent in October. But now Larsen wants four more on top of Vuyani Ntanga, Lerato Lamola, Wayde Jooste, Limbikani Mzava, Cliffton Miheso and Lee Langeveld that he signed in July, to strengthen his side when the transfer window opens in five days. &ldquo;The position that I feel we need strengthening is in the striking department. I need a new striker and midfielder to complement Dikgacoi, Musa Bilankulu and Danny Phiri. In all I will need four players to transform my team,&rdquo; said Larsen He added that the new players would have to be locals since their foreign quota was already full. The former Bloemfontein Celtic coach wasn&rsquo;t in a position to name the players he hoped to bring to the club, but said whoever they got would have to come in and be able to help the team when the league resumes on 8 February, when Arrows travel to Atteridgeville&rsquo;s Lucas Moripe Stadium to face Premiership leaders SuperSport United.&ldquo;We have no choice but to look here at home. There aren&rsquo;t many players here though, but we will look carefully. &ldquo;As it stands our foreign quota is full. We will look at other teams and see who is available and also take a look at available free agents. It&rsquo;s not easy to find players you want, but we&rsquo;ll keep looking,&rdquo; added Larsen. Arrows ended their first round and went on the festive break with a defeat to Kaizer Chiefs. They were unable to reach their target of 23 points in 15 matches and instead managed to collect 20 points, ending in sixth position.
