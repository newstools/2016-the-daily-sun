MADALA Sello Manzini (60) has gone for the last 20 years without a poke and he&rsquo;s tired of it.Sello, from Jerusalem squatter camp in Roodepoort, Joburg told Daily Sun his days are numbered. &ldquo;My wish is to have one last poke before I leave this world.&rdquo; He said he thinks he was bewitched when he was 40 years old and living in Germiston, Ekurhuleni.&ldquo;I had a girlfriend and I thought we would get married. I had a good job and everything was fine.&rdquo; But his girlfriend fell ill and died in November 1996. &ldquo;We had planned to get married in December that same year. &ldquo;I mourned her death for some time.&ldquo;Years later I started looking for a partner but I never found one.&rdquo;He said he moved to Orange Farm, south of Joburg and found a girlfriend.&ldquo;We never had sex but things were looking good.&rdquo;But one day he came home to find he had been thrown out of his shack. &ldquo;I left Orange Farm and lost contact with my girlfriend.&rdquo; He moved to Mofolo, Soweto where after five years, he again met a woman, but she was run over and died. &ldquo;We were still getting to know each other. We never had sex.&rdquo; He moved to a run-down house in Snake Park, Soweto and fixed the house but he was evicted there as well. &ldquo;I had met a woman and things were promising but I had to move.&rdquo;He said he is in Jerusalem now, but he thinks he might die before he gets a woman.Sangoma Jabulani Mthimkhulu said the madala should have held a cleansing ceremony after his first girlfriend died.&ldquo;It seems like her spirit is following him and is very jealous. He won&rsquo;t have any woman in his life unless he does a cleansing.&rdquo;
