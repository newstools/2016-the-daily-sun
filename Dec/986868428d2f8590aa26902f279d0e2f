SOLLY Mkhize is happy to be alive after he was hijacked by men who locked him up for two hours! However, the EFF councillor said his Mercedes-Benz is gone and the police are on the hunt for two suspects. The 39-year-old from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, said he was with a friend on Tuesday when two people, one carrying a gun, approached them. &ldquo;They pointed the firearm at me, forced me into the back of my car and drove off.&rdquo; Solly, an EFF councillor and policy researcher said the two men covered his head with a balaclava before driving off with him. He said he was taken to a strange house and forced into a dark, empty room. &ldquo;They left me there while they looked for the tracker in the car. &ldquo;At first I thought they were going to kill me. &ldquo;But when they put the balaclava over my head, I knew they were cowards.&rdquo; Solly said after two hours of terror, the hijackers dropped him on the R550 road and he called his family to pick him up. &ldquo;They left with his white Mercedes-Benz, which is worth about R280 000. &ldquo;The vehicle&rsquo;s registration number is ZJG 366 GP. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a huge relief for me to be back home with my children and family. &ldquo;No one expects something like this to happen to them.&rdquo; Solly said the hijackers gave him his phone, licence and house keys before dumping him on the road. Police spokesman Captain Piet Rossouw said cops were investigating a case of hijacking. &ldquo;No one has been arrested yet. &ldquo;We are appealing to the public to share any useful information with officers at their nearest police station.&rdquo;
