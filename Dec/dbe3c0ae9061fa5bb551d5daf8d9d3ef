KEAGAN DOLLY insisted he doesn&rsquo;t want to live in the shadows of his role model, Steven Pienaar. The 34-year-old Pienaar has had an incredible professional career. He started at Ajax Cape Town in 1999 via sister club Ajax Amsterdam, in Holland &ndash; to Germany &ndash; where he played for Borussia Dortmund, and went on to England, where he stole the hearts of Everton fans, together with those of Sunderland, where he&rsquo;s currently plying his trade.When Pienaar went to a bigger tournament to compete for the first time, it was in the 2002 World Cup hosted in Korea/Japan.Now his homeboy, Dolly, seems to have followed the same route to stardom that started at armature side Westbury Arsenal, in Joburg, and now Japan, where his side Mamelodi Sundowns recently competed in the Fifa Club World Cup.Like Pienaar before he retired from international duty, the 23-year-old winger is also a regular member in the Bafana Bafana squad. But the skilful player revealed he would like to write his own script, instead of being the shadow of the player nicknamed &ldquo;Schillo&rdquo;, after the exploits of Italian striker Toto Schillaci during the 1990 World Cup.Said Dolly: &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve always been compared to Steven (Pienaar) because we come from the same area. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s someone I&rsquo;ve always looked up to and I&rsquo;ve been following his career. But I want to create my own image.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to always be in his shadows. I don&rsquo;t want people to also talk about me whenever they talk about Pienaar.&rdquo;Dolly revealed that creating his own image will inspire youngsters to take their career seriously.&ldquo;I want to write my own script, so that I can inspire other youngsters in Mzansi,&rdquo; Dolly added.&ldquo;People say we play similar, but I want to live my dream. I want to play in places where I want to see my career continue to blossom.&rdquo;
