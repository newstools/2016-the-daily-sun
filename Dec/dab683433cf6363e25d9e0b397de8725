LIFE has become a nightmare for the parents of Hlelo Phiri, a one- year-old child suffering from a malignant brain tumour.&ldquo;When Hlelo turned eight months old he got sick. We thought it was a normal sickness as he is a growing child but it became a traumatising nightmare,&rdquo; said Nomsa Mamba, Hlelo&rsquo;s mum. The family lives in Matsulu, just outside Mbombela.Hlelo was just learning to walk when the tumour struck. Realising he was not getting well, the family took him to a private hospital. Doctors discovered a neoplasm, or abnormal tissue growth, in the pineal gland. It blocked the free flow of liquid and caused the head to grow and Hlelo&rsquo;s behaviour to alter. Hlelo&rsquo;s mum says she is unable to work as she is always besides Hlelo&rsquo;s bed. The family began the campaign &ldquo;Cancer Walk For Hlelo&rdquo; in Matsulu. Hlelo&rsquo;s uncle, Linda Phiri, said: &ldquo;We sold pink ribbons and T-shirts. This was our way to raise funds to settle hospital bills. We also appreciate the prayers we receive every day.&rdquo; He pleaded with the public for further assistance.&ldquo;We are pleading for donations as he also deserves to grow like other kids. Any amount can give Hlelo another chance at life.&rdquo; Contact Daily Sun if you want to help. &ndash; AENS
