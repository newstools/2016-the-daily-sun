TAXI drivers who break the rules of the road and are rude to their customers will soon find themselves in big trouble.&nbsp; Philip Taaibosch, South African National Taxi Council president, warned that the organisation will start getting tough with those working in the industry.&nbsp; He said the organisation was working with the courts to find ways to support law enforcement and to make sure offenders received harsher sentences.&nbsp; &ldquo;We need to have an industry with people who have manners and respect for other road users.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will make sure all crimes committed by taxi drivers are dealt with harshly to ensure there is law and order on the roads.&rdquo;&nbsp; Taaibosch said the taxi accidents that had occurred over the past few weeks were very worrying and had led to the organisation looking for ways to ensure drivers followed the rules of the road. &ldquo;Last year we saw taxi accidents dropping to 6% of the road death toll, but those gains have been turned around.&nbsp; &ldquo;We intend to act in support of court processes and to call for harsher sentences for drivers whose ill-disciplined behaviour claims lives and causes injuries.&rdquo;&nbsp; Taaibosch said reports indicated that about 80% of accidents on South African roads were caused by human error.&nbsp; He said the organisation needed to become a friend of the courts when drivers were summoned by the law.&nbsp; He urged commuters and the public to partner with the industry by reporting bad driving and drivers who broke the rules of the road, as well as overloading and unroadworthy vehicles.&nbsp; Complaints about taxi drivers&rsquo; behaviour can be reported on 073&thinsp;356&thinsp;8500.&nbsp;
