THESE residents are up in arms because they have been without water for more than three weeks. The people of Lakeside, south of Joburg, took to the street on Saturday, blocking roads with large bricks and burning tyres. They said despite efforts to raise their concerns with Emfuleni Municipality, their complaints fell on deaf ears. They said they have been struggling with unreliable water supply for more than five months. Resident Nomvula Mkhonza (48) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We have been without water for the past three weeks and we&rsquo;re forced to live like pigs. We can&rsquo;t bath or even use the toilets. They told us the valves aren&rsquo;t working, yet I pay my bond every month.&rdquo; Mpumi Velankuna (32) told the SunTeam residents put their lives in danger every time they went to collect water.&ldquo;This place is dangerous, especially for women. You never know if you might get raped.&rdquo; Municipal manager Ernie Strydom said; &ldquo;We are aware of the matter. We are trying to deal with this but as you know, the country has been struggling with a water shortage. We are forced to cut off some areas and implement water rationing. We are having problems with our reservoir and we&rsquo;re looking at a long-term solution. &ldquo;We ask residents to bear with us while we&rsquo;re trying to attend to the matter. We have sent trucks to the area for the time being and we would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused.&rdquo;
