EVEN driving an old car doesn&rsquo;t mean thugs won&rsquo;t get to you too.This is what residents of Ratanda, Heidelberg, south of Joburg came to realise as even 40-year-old cars are being stolen.Victims claim the thugs burn muthi to make them sleep while they go about stealing their vintage wheels. When they wake up, they find their old cars gone.Cops are still searching for many of them.Some people believe that the old cars are sold in rural areas as they can withstand the tough road conditions there.&ldquo;New cars break down because they are sensitive to dust and their computerised systems are hard to fix in rural areas,&rdquo; said a resident.&ldquo;The old cars are strong and probably fetch good prices.&rdquo;The most popular brands include Toyota Corollas, Mazda 323s and Nissan 1400s.&ldquo;These thugs are smart. They steal our cars even when we have chained them up. I suspect they burn muthi to make us fall asleep. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t hear our dogs bark or the engines starting. It&rsquo;s unbelievable,&rdquo; said a victim.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m devastated. My 1980 Toyota Corolla was my prized possession.&rdquo;He said he bought the car from a second-hand dealer 10 years ago.&ldquo;I pimped it and it was beautiful. Even a pretty woman couldn&rsquo;t resist a lift when offered one. I&rsquo;m just praying my car will be found,&rdquo; he said.Community policing forum chairman Vusi Mbele said he suspects the stolen cars are used as taxis in other townships.Theft cases were opened at Ratanda Police Station and cops are still investigating.
