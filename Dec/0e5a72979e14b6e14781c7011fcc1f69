THE so-called Doom prophet has finally been stopped by a court order.For months Lethebo Rabaloga, a preacher from Mount Zion General Assembly in Limpopo, has been spraying poisonous insecticide on his congregation to &ldquo;drive out demons&rdquo;. He made the news a few weeks back when he claimed that spraying the household insecticide Doom on his flock would heal them.The Limpopo High Court has now granted an interdict against Lethebo and his dangerous sermons. The church&rsquo;s Facebook page makes the claim that the prophet first commands demons to enter the congregants&rsquo; bodies, as &ldquo;demons need flesh to operate.&rdquo; He then is said to address the demons, and finally drives them out of their bodies &ndash; a kind of exorcism by fumigation. Limpopo Health Department spokesman Derrick Kganyago says the department has been granted an interdict to stop the Doom prophet. Kganyago said the department wanted Lethebo to first be mentally evaluated, and last week they applied for the interdict in the Limpopo High Court. &ldquo;We wanted him to be mentally evaluated first because this is unhuman.&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t spray Doom on people. Now we have launched an interdict to stop him and his church from spraying people with doom, and the High Court has granted it,&rdquo; he said. &ndash; AENS
