DJ AND TV personality, Sam Lehoko, aka &ldquo;Sammy Sosa&rdquo;, is a &ldquo;heartbroken&rdquo; woman.This after a tweet that suggested she was beaten up in what seemed to be a domestic violence incident midweek.She tweeted: Tonight a man hit me in my own home. Marks on my back. Red AF. Ladies, be careful. Not every man loves you even when they say they do.This raised eyebrows as she has publicly shown affection for hip hop DJ Deetoy &ldquo;King&rdquo; Ramokhoase, from Sebokeng, in the Vaal.This has led her fans to suspect King is the culprit who raised his hand on Sammy.&ldquo;This is very sad, if it happened. Sammy has been going through a lot this year and to have this happening is heartbreaking. I hope she goes on and open a case and see it through until the end,&rdquo; said one source.Another source said relationships have different dynamics, but resorting to violence is never a solution.&ldquo;This is especially tragic because this is happening during the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children campaign,&rdquo; said another source.This year alone, Sammy has worked for three radio stations: from YFM to having been allegedly fired from Metro FM&rsquo;s mid-morning show, and having a short stint at Power FM, to being part of Touch Central.She was also embroiled in a bitter cash refund spat with an up-an-coming singer, where she was allegedly paid R20 000, but never delivered on being part of that song. Sammy said: &ldquo;Please call me in an hour&rsquo;s time as I&rsquo;m driving to Rustenburg for an outside broadcast.&rdquo;Deetoy said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about what you&rsquo;re asking me.&rdquo; When asked if he&rsquo;s still dating Sammy, he laughed it off and hung up.
