IT LOOKS like any other squatter camp rising from the ground on an empty piece of land. Hands are swinging hammers, corrugated iron walls and roofs are erected and sweat drips from brows. But unlike other squatter camps, in this one the work is being done by women only!In fact the whole of Sisters squatter camp is for women only. Close to 100 families run by women occupy the land bordering Ulanda squatter camp in Ekurhuleni. The strong women here say they don&rsquo;t need men! &ldquo;Men are nothing but trouble,&rdquo; said Gloria Mdluli. Daily Sun found her busy constructing her shack, standing on top of a dustbin, and hammering in long nails to attach the corrugated iron to a wooden structure. Gloria said the woman there had only themselves to depend on.&ldquo;We do things for ourselves because some men take advantage and charge us too much money.&rdquo;Her 18-year-old daughter, Lungile, stood next to her mum with a saw in one hand while helping her mum hammer in nails.&ldquo;We encourage other women to follow suit and do it for themselves,&rdquo; said Gloria, who added that she was instilling the same qualities in her daughter.&ldquo;I want to teach her to do things for herself and not depend on anyone else.&rdquo; Another resident Dora Sithole said she learned to depend on herself after her husband died.&ldquo;It was hard because I relied on him for everything,&rdquo; she said.Dora said she tried to get another man to help her but she was only left disappointed.&ldquo;Men are stressful. It&rsquo;s better to depend on yourself.&rdquo;A vocal Jeannette Motsiri said: &ldquo;Viva to independent women! We run our small businesses to feed our kids.&rdquo; Gloria said she was also planning to start an organisation to encourage other women who still depended on men to tap into the power within themselves.&ldquo;We are powerful. We can achieve anything we set our minds to.&rdquo;
