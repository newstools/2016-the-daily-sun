FOR over a month, not a drop has come out of the residents&rsquo; taps.In desperation, they turned to the only choice they had &ndash; and got their water from stormwater drains. But this too is running dry as no rain fallen for almost two weeks, and now they face a dry Christmas.Residents of Hlalanikahle, near Witbank in Mpumalanga, said they last had water in their homes over a month ago, and that the municipality hadn&rsquo;t bothered to come and explain the problem to them. Resident Thobile Nzima (38) said life without running water was a struggle and they have been left looking for ponds or stormwater drains. &ldquo;Nobody has come to even tell us what the problem is. &ldquo;We are supposed to start enjoying our festive season, but it&rsquo;s like living in a desert.&rdquo; They didn&rsquo;t even have clean water to cook and bath in at home and had to go to work dirty! Vusi Mkhwanazi (25) said it was well known that people threw their rubbish and even dead animals in the drain. &ldquo;We cannot afford to live without water, so we drink it even though we know it is contaminated.&rdquo;Emalahleni municipal spokesman Kingdom Mabuza said the water shortage was a result of planned maintenance of an electricity sub station, which pumps water from the Witbank Dam. &ldquo;The maintenance team has completed its work. &ldquo;The process of pumping water to reach taps has been delayed and it might take a while still before residents will see water coming from their taps.&rdquo;
