WHEN Malitaba tried to chase the chicken away, it just stood there, staring at her. &ldquo;I know chickens run away when people come near them, so it was strange the white cock sat still without moving,&rdquo; said Malitaba Motjakotja (51), a prophet from Thaba Nchu, Free State.&nbsp; &ldquo;I become scared when I realised half the body of the chicken was buried underground. There was also black muthi around its waist, which made me realise that the chicken represented evil.&rdquo; Malitaba said she and her sister, Manana Moopeloa (48) had been dreaming of death before they found the chicken on Friday. Malitaba consulted a sangoma and she was told if the chicken died in their yard, somebody in the family would die. The sangoma came to perform rituals to remove the spell and took the chicken away.&nbsp; Malitaba said Manana was on her way to work when she saw the chicken. Malitaba said: &ldquo;I remembered the death dreams and I consulted the sangoma. I&rsquo;m happy my ancestors saved us from this evil.&rdquo; Sangoma Thabo Marusu said the chicken was meant to hurt Malitaba&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; He said it was sent by an evil person who is jealous of Malitaba&rsquo;s powers as a prophet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Malitaba must thank her dead mum&rsquo;s spirit as it stopped the evil.&rdquo;&nbsp;
