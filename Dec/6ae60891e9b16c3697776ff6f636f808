WILLEM Oosthuizen and Theo Jackson claim they did not mean to harm Rethabile Mlotshwa when they forced him into a coffin.They claim they just wanted to teach Mlotshwa a lesson.This was argued by their advocate, John Welch, on Friday. Welch was reading from their affidavits during a bail hearing at Middelburg Magistrates Court. Oosthuizen and Jackson made headlines after they posted a video of themselves shoving Mlothshwa into a coffin. They accused Mlothshwa of trespassing and threatened to burn him alive.The pair, who withdrew their bail application on 16 November, have once again applied for bail. The court began hearing the application on Thursday.Outside, a crowd of about 300 ANC members staged a protest, demanding the accused be denied bail. Investigating officer Constable Dimakatso Bahula told the court if the two were released on bail, there would be bloodshed in Mpumalanga. She said there was also a possibility the accused could interfere with the investigation if released. Bahula&rsquo;s claims were supported by Warrant Officer Enrico Giorgiutti, who told the court one of the farmers in the area laid an intimidation charge after he received an SMS threatening his family. Oosthuizen works for the farmer who was threatened. In part, the SMS read: &ldquo;Afrikaner boy, you and your manager put our brother in a coffin. &ldquo;Now we are after you. &ldquo;Watch this space. &ldquo;The battle is on. &ldquo;It is closer than you think. Get ready. There will be bloodshed.&rdquo; The matter has been postponed to 8 December.
