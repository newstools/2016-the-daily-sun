Sibusiso alleged last Monday he was with friends when the off-duty policeman stopped him in town, handcuffed him and forced him into a car.&ldquo;He drove the car to the nearby bush. &ldquo;We found his two friends waiting for him.

But, said Sibusiso, from 25 November to 3 December his whole family was in Vryheid.&ldquo;I told them I was not in town, but they continued to beat me. I didn&rsquo;t steal his items, but they beat me until they thought I was dead and left me alone in the bush.&rdquo; His brother, Sithembiso Manana (31) told the People&rsquo;s Paper he thanked his ancestors for making him drive past the bush where his brother was lying helpless.&ldquo;A herd boy stopped me, asking me to help the man in the bush. When I got there it was my brother! I rushed him to hospital. &ldquo;He was with me in Vryheid during the time they claim he broke into the cop&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; said Manana.At the time of going to print, KZN cop spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said they were unable to check on the case because Mtubatuba and KwaMsane cop shops&rsquo; computers were offline.
