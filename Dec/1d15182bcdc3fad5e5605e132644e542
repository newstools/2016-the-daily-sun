HLAUDI Motsoeneng has called himself the most powerful person in Mzansi and the ANC Youth League in KZN is pushing for him to be given a ministerial position.The former SABC chief operating officer said the broadcaster had been transformed under his direction.Speaking to about 80 people at an ANCYL event in the Durban CBD on Tuesday, he said what he did has never happened at the SABC.&ldquo;We closed our eyes and empowered black people unapologetically,&rdquo; Motsoeneng said.He added that people knew his name because he touched a nerve. He said the 90% local content contribution was his doing and was why people opposing him were making a noise.&ldquo;They know in the meetings I defeat them,&rdquo; Motsoeneng said.The Western Cape High Court ruled on 12 December that Motsoeneng may not hold any position in the SABC.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a title, but I am an employee of the SABC. I don&rsquo;t need a title to change the lives of people. I need myself.&rdquo; He said the board members used to use their votes to agree with him but now they are saying something else.&ldquo;They are saying, &lsquo;It was Hlaudi who took that decision&rsquo;, which means I am the most powerful person in South Africa.&ldquo;If those decisions have assisted the SABC to empower black people, I am very proud.&rdquo;ANCYL regional secretary Thinta Cibane said yesterday that the league would put pressure on government for Motsoeneng to be appointed as a minister.&ldquo;He will bring transformation to departments,&rdquo; Cibane said.He added the league was concerned about ANC members being part of the SABC parliamentary inquiry.&ldquo;It is ridiculous that these so called ANC members agree publicly but privately with the DA and EFF,&rdquo; Cibane said. &ndash; NEWS24
