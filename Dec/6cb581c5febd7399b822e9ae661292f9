THERE was no merry Christmas at Legae la Batho. The electricity went off in this kasi near Polokwane, Limpopo after heavy rain. Festive food went rotten and had to be replaced after four days in fridges without power. So the feast cost double! Residents took their frustration to the road and blocked Nelson Mandela Drive between Polokwane and Seshego on Monday. Police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said: &ldquo;Protesters blocked the road but we managed to disperse them and remove all the items they had put there. We opened the road and are monitoring the situation.&rdquo; A resident told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;Every week we spend at least two days without electricity. &ldquo;This started in 2010, and we keep on reporting the matter to the municipality. &ldquo;We had to take our spoiled food to the rubbish dump, and that is unacceptable!&rdquo; Tshidiso Mothapo, a spokesman for Polokwane Municipality, said the situation in Legae la Batho is being addressed. &ldquo;We had an electricity fault caused by lightning at a substation but our team is working on fixing it. We have provided the area with a generator while we seek a permanent solution. &ldquo;The municipality needs about R2 billion to address all the challenges in the area,&rdquo; he said.
