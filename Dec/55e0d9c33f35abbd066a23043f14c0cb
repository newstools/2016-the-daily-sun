&ldquo;I PRAY to God every day and believe my dolls protect me against tokoloshes and witches that want to kill me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jeffery Twala (54) keeps a variety of dolls and figurines in his yard to scare away evil in Philippi, close to Cape Town.&nbsp; He explained how he places the dolls in strategic places in his yard in Bhekela to protect him.&nbsp; &ldquo;This doll here of a woman who is praying is called Mama Maria and she protects me against witches who target me,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Near to praying Mama Maria is an owl.&ldquo;The owl represents evil spirits and placing it near the praying doll means that all evil things are being watched.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twala worked for an electrical engineering company until illness last year forced him into early retirement.&nbsp; &ldquo;Since the first day I got sick, my life has never been the same. I immediately suspected someone was bewitching me. I was always sick because some people were jealous of me. I feel much better as long as my dolls are around. I kneel and pray so that no evil power or tokoloshe can win against me.&rdquo;&nbsp; His wife Fundiswa Twala (60) is also unemployed and makes money by picking up plastic bottles and selling them to a recycling company. That is where Twala found his first dolls. &ldquo;I once accompanied my wife to pick up some plastic bottles.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is when I first saw the doll of praying Mama Maria and I liked it right away. I immediately knew how to use it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I only pray for more strength, to have my health back so that I can work again.&rdquo;
