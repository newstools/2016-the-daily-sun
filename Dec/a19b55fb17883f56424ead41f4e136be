STRESS and exhaustion may lead to many health-related issues. The holidays don&rsquo;t help either, as most people end up eating unhealthy foods.Andrea du Plessis, Vital Health Foods&rsquo; nutrition expert, said the brain, like any part of the body, needs nourishment, stimulation and proper rest , but it&rsquo;s often the most neglected part of the body. There are various ways to make sure that you are taking care of your body this festive season, such as by drinking more water and getting enough sleep.According to a survey by the American Psychological Association, up to two thirds of employees suffer from burnout towards the end of the work year. There&rsquo;s little reason to believe the figures should be any different in South Africa.Two major symptoms of burnout include emotional exhaustion and reduced performance. But by making small changes to your diet and lifestyle you can become healthier every day, and combat stress and fatigue.Andrea recommended a diet rich in eggs, oily fish, nuts and seeds to provide the correct nutrients to feed your brain. &ldquo;Omega 3 fatty acids form part of the brain cell structure.&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re concerned that you&rsquo;re not getting enough oily fish, which contain this chemical, there are supplements like Vital with its Omega 3 concentrate that contains 1 000mg of fish oil.&ldquo;The B vitamins, which include B1, B3, B6 and B9, support essential functions such as the immune and nervous systems, the metabolism, skin and muscles. &ldquo;B vitamins are found in eggs, fish, red meat, pulses and legumes but an easy way to get your daily dose is from Vital Maxi B,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When it comes to exercise, take the stairs instead of the lift. It&rsquo;s a small effort that makes a difference over time.&ldquo;Even during times of fun and rest, the brain is still very active.&rdquo; She recommended that adults should sleep at least eight hours a night.&ldquo;Getting enough sleep lets your body and brain recharge,&rdquo; Andrea said.
