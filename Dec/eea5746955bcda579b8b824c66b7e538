THE sweets sell for as little as 30 cents each and according to residents of Etwatwa in Ekurhuleni, they have been laced with drugs! The sweets have been named Delu Umoya, which means if you eat them, you give up your life. However, their real name is Dela Mora and they are manufactured by O&rsquo;Yea Sweets in Crown Mines, Joburg. Fatima Esack, the company&rsquo;s procurement manager, said they were unhappy about what&rsquo;s allegedly been done to their product. &ldquo;A few weeks ago, a man bought our sweets from a shop in Moffat View and allegedly injected a substance into them before giving them to kids at a school in the south of Joburg,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;The kids became ill and were taken to hospital. &ldquo;That was when the rumour that our sweets contain drugs started. &ldquo;We want to assure the public our sweets are in perfect condition when they leave the factory.&ldquo;It was just an unfortunate incident and the cops have confirmed our sweets were not the only ones which were injected with drugs.&rdquo;The SunTeam spoke to several teenagers in Ekurhuleni, who claimed they felt strange after eating the sweets. &ldquo;You get high and start doing strange things after eating them. &ldquo;I used to buy them but after seeing Facebook posts about them, I stopped,&rdquo; said one teenager. Parents also told the SunTeam they have stopped their kids buying the sweets. Martha Monare said: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what is used to make these sweets.&rdquo; The owner of a shop in Etwatwa said he bought the sweets from other retailers and wasn&rsquo;t aware of any problems. Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubela confirmed kids were admitted to hospital after eating sweets laced with poison.However, he said the sweets were tested but no poison was found in them. No arrests have been made.
