Dear MizzBI&rsquo;m a 22-year-old guy and I had a one night stand with this girl four months ago. She is now back and claims to be pregnant.&nbsp;But I don&rsquo;t understand because we used a condom when we had sex. She insists that I am the father because she has never slept with anyone besides me. Do you think it is possible that I might indeed be the father? &nbsp;- ConfusedDear ConfusedIt&rsquo;s possible to fall pregnant if the condom was used incorrectly wrong. Did you check the condom after sex? It&rsquo;s best to wait until the baby is born and then request a DNA test to see if the child is yours or not. These cases are not easy, especially if you are sure you didn&rsquo;t impregnate her. In future, check the condom after sex with your partner so that you both know for sure that the condom was foolproof.
