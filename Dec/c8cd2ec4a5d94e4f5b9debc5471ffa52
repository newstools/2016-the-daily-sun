BANYANA Banyana interim coach Desiree Ellis believes that having more players abroad will elevate the standard of her team. After a disappointing campaign at the recent Caf Africa Women&rsquo;s Cup of Nations, Ellis said the countries that have players in European and other leagues on the continent had the upper hand. This comes after Banyana captain, Janine van Wyk secured a move to American club Houston Dash for next season while former Bantwana captain Rachel Sebati joined Italian side AFC Fiorentina.Van Wyk joins a number of players overseas including Jermaine Seoposenwe, Kaylin Swart, Amanda Sister, Meagan Newman and Robyn Moodaly. Banyana has also had several players in different leagues around the world before, including the likes of Andisiwe Mgcoyi, Nompumelelo Nyandeni, Lerato Kgasago, Busisiwe Ndimeni and Disebo Mametja, while retired striker Portia Modise played at Arsenal in her heyday.Ellis said Van Wyk&rsquo;s move came unexpectedly but was well deserved. She said: &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t expect it so soon but she deserves it. It came with hard work and dedication. We saw on the Twitter timeline there were a lot of compliments and suggestion for her to get a move to the US after our friendly there before the Olympics. I hope more will get moves to other countries. If there are, I will be happy. It will take us to a different level.&rdquo;As Banyana gear to face France in a friendly on 22 January, the former captain said she hoped they would gain a lot from it and more players getting offers. &ldquo;We always want to play big teams. We want to see where we are in terms of the standard and tactical awareness. &ldquo;I know we have to conquer Africa first, but we have to learn as much as we can from the best in the world,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;For us, there is always room for improvement,&rdquo; added Ellis.
