PANTIES and bongas is a stokvel to die for!And on Saturday it lived up to its name when one of the stokvel&rsquo;s patrons was killed. The man, dressed to the nines in a pair of blue jeans and matching casual blue shirt did not even get to set foot in the venue. On arrival at Maria&rsquo;s Place in Klipgat, the man was said to have driven around in a maroon VW Jetta looking for a parking spot. It was late at night and the place was already full. Eventually the man found parking but just as he was about to step out of his car he was greeted by a shower of bullets. He fell face down and died on the spot.People ran for cover while others screamed for help as they ran into the tavern. After a while the patrons went outside to see what was happening and the police were called. But then people just moved back inside and continued with their party. Women from the stokve danced erotically, encouraging the DJ to hit them with more hits.Most said that although someone had died, life must and does go on... North West police spokesman Lieutenant- Colonel Pelonomi Makau said a case of murder was opened at Klipgat Police Station. &ldquo;No arrest has been made so far,&rdquo; she said.
