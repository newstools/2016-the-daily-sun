WHEN the mysterious death of Kingsley Railo was announced two weeks ago, everyone in his community was shocked. The 17-year-old from Setumong Village, near Polokwane in Limpopo, was the seventh person in the area to die suddenly this month. Villagers now believe someone is using a type of poison called &ldquo;seven days&rdquo; to kill people at local events and funerals. According to residents, once a person had been fed the poison, they will vomit and have stomach problems for seven days before dying. Kingsley&rsquo;s mum Mpho (49) said: &ldquo;My boy was healthy and when he suddenly started vomiting, I didn&rsquo;t ever suspect he would die. &ldquo;I realised he had a serious problem after a classmate brought him home because he had collapsed at school. &ldquo;He died later while watching TV,&rdquo; she said. Villagers said they believed the poison used to kill Kingsley was being sold at social grant paypoints in the community. An old man said: &ldquo;We are worried because whoever is poisoning people seems to be doing it just for fun. &ldquo;Even young people have been dying. &ldquo;People no longer want to eat at funerals. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re too scared to eat because no one knows who is poisoning residents.&rdquo; Puleng Matlala (19), a pupil at Mapule Secondary School, said Kingsley&rsquo;s death had scared him. &ldquo;He fears he could be the next victim. Limpopo police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said: &ldquo;If the community suspects these people have been poisoned, they should come forward to open cases. &ldquo;Then the bodies can be tested and our forensic team can conduct further investigations.&ldquo;Instead of consulting a sangoma, we urge residents to come forward with information.
