A GOGO living with a disability is appealing to Good Samaritans to help her repair her crumbling house. Evelyn Molisi (71) from Motherwell NU 2 in Port Elizabeth claims that political parties only use her house for election campaigns to get votes.&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t even enjoy Christmas because of the state of my house,&rdquo; said Evelyn, who lives with seven family members. &ldquo;Since 2003, I haven&rsquo;t enjoyed Christmas with my family because we fear that the house may fall on us. &ldquo;The house is just falling apart because there are huge cracks in the walls. &ldquo;I tried to close the cracks with newspapers, but the wind just blows them away.&rdquo;She said the situation is affecting her grandkids badly.&ldquo;My grandchildren don&rsquo;t perform well at school because they are being teased by other kids for living in a crumbling house.&ldquo;This has also affected my health badly. My diabetes and blood pressure are not stable, and doctors are worried,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have money to fix my house as I depend on my pension to survive. &ldquo;Before the municipal election, people from different parties came to my house and promised to fix it, but with no luck.&rdquo; Lwandile Sicwetsha, spokesman for human settlements, said: &ldquo;This is a bonded house, so it&rsquo;s the owner&rsquo;s responsibility to fix it.&rdquo;
