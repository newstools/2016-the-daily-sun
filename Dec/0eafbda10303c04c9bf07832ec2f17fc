A FRIEND of mine, who&rsquo;s a staunch Kaizer Chiefs supporter, said the saddest thing right now with Amakhosi is they can still win the 2016/17 PSL title.He said if that were to happen, it would be his saddest year since he started rooting for the Glamour Boys at the age of five in the early 80s.I&rsquo;m not sure if it was him talking or if the single malt whisky in his glass had become his spokesperson.That&rsquo;s just how much Chiefs supporters hate the current set-up at what used to be the biggest club in Mzansi.Chiefs are now just one game away from matching their 2001/02 nine-match winless streak. They&rsquo;ve gone eight games without a single victory.It&rsquo;s not about not winning a single game in eight outings nor ending a season without a trophy &ndash; it&rsquo;s just that that everything seems to be going pear-shaped. Wrong people occupy crucial positions &ndash; without the street smart skills of running a soccer club. And the sad thing is they don&rsquo;t take kindly to criticism. They give you the cold treatment if you dare question their know-how.Bobby Motaung&rsquo;s title is &ldquo;football manager&rdquo;. What the hell is a football manager? Is it the same role that Alex Ferguson played at Manchester United? I wonder. Fair enough Jessica Motaung is the marketing director &ndash; you see her now and then pretending to be busy. There&rsquo;s also Kemiso Motaung and now Kaizer Junior. Now, if this isn&rsquo;t stepping on each other&rsquo;s toes, then I don&rsquo;t understand what is happening at Mount Naturena.There&rsquo;s an idiom: a fish rots from the head down. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with Kaizer Senior&rsquo;s chiskop, it&rsquo;s still shiny and well-kempt. But. . . Or maybe I&rsquo;m still old-fashioned and believe the nucleus of a club is built on three critical aspects: supporters, a good coach and a strong starting line-up. None of the above are there at the club.Supporters are not cheering on the club in this time of need. In fact, they wanted to have an up, close and personal meeting with the coach last week after the 3-1 defeat to Chippa United &ndash; but security guards and cops vigorously declined the fans&rsquo; request.The more coach Steve Komphela keeps on losing games, the more he is mixing metaphors and scrambling his own brain trying to make sense. Thirdly, the current crop of players were bought badly. Only a handful could match the likes of former superstars Nelson &ldquo;Teenage&rdquo; Dladla, Pule &ldquo;Ace&rdquo; Ntsoelengoe, Scara Thindwa, Marks Maponyane, Peter Bala&rsquo;c, Shane McGregor, Samora Khulu and Jan &ldquo;Malombo&rdquo; Lichaba.We have seen very little of Edmore Chimbadare, Lewis Macha and Michelle Katsvairo and haven&rsquo;t been impressed at all. I think &ldquo;Bobbsteak&rdquo; pulled a fast one on fans and brought them car mechanics from Zimbabwe.The likes of George Lebese, Lucky Baloyi, George Maluleka, Keagan Buchanan, Pule Ekstein must really up their game. They have God-given talent and the measure to make an impression. But at the moment, they&rsquo;re blowing hot and cold and choose the kind of games where they want to dish out five-star performances.Ekstein was at one stage touted as the new Emmanuel &ldquo;Scara&rdquo; Ngobese &ndash; but in all fairness, Ekstein can&rsquo;t even wash Ngobese&rsquo;s boots.Chiefs missed a trick when Mpumalanga Black Aces was being sold. Many players were unsettled and unhappy when they were forced to relocate to Cape Town. We&rsquo;re talking about players such as Lebo Manyama, Bhongolethu Jayiya, Sibusiso Masina and Judas Moseamedi who have taken the PSL by storm this season. Thabo Mnyamane was also available when AmaTuks was relegated. SuperSport United got him and their die-hard fans are smiling. And as for Chiefs, the chaos and the confusion continue to reign supreme. Poor fans!
