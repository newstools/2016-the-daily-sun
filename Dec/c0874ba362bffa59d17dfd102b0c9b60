WHEN a 12-year-old girl from Mamelodi, Tshwane went missing two months ago her family was devastated. They decided to consult a sangom, who told them that she was still alive and would be coming home soon. Indeed, she returned home, but her life will never be the same again. She returned home on Thursday, wasted and wounded.She was kidnapped, raped and drugged by a man in Sunnyside the whole time she was away.Her uncle (55) from Ga-Rankuwa said: &ldquo;Her friends told me that she left with a woman they didn&rsquo;t know. Luckily they had her number. I then called her and she told me that my niece had slept at her place because it was late. She said my niece left the following morning.&rdquo;He said he was surprised and happy when his younger brother called to tell him that his niece had returned.&ldquo;When we asked her where she had been, she started crying. She told us that she was kept at Sunnyside against her will.&rdquo;&ldquo;I hope the cops will question the woman who said she slept at her place.&rdquo;Warrant Officer Daniel Mavimbela, police spokesman, confirmed that a man (27) was arrested and appeared in the Pretoria Magistrates Court on Monday. He was charged with rape and kidnapping.
