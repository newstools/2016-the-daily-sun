RESIDENTS are so angry with the cops in their kasi, they want the cop shop to close.&ldquo;This is a Mickey Mouse station,&rdquo; chanted the residents of Inanda, eThekwini as they marched to the Vela Satellite Police Station. The residents accused the cops of being lazy, rude, accepting bribes from thugs and turning the station into a holiday resort. Sikho Madazukana (26), spokesman for the residents, told Daily Sun the cop shop must change or be shut down.&ldquo;Sometimes we suffer a double blow, first by the thugs and then by the cops. There is no privacy when reporting a case.&rdquo; He said if their demands are not met the station should be shut down or turned into a different facility that will benefit residents.Brigadier Jay Naicker, KZN cops spokesman, confirmed that residents handed over their letter of concerns to Colonel Mandlakhe Ndaba, who will forward it to cluster commander Major-General Bernnet Nxabela. Madazukana said they want a written response no later than 9 December.
