ST ALBAN&rsquo;S Prison in Port Elizabeth is on lockdown and all family visits have been suspended after a clash between warders and inmates on Monday led to three deaths.Prison officials have blamed overcrowding, staff shortages and gangsterism at the prison for the incident during which inmates reportedly tried to take control of the prison. One prisoner died at the scene and two others later died in Livingstone Hospital. Another 25 inmates were injured and 10 were left in a critical condition. The violence is believed to have broken out in the C Max section of the prison during breakfast on Monday.The prison has in the past been described as the most violent in the Eastern Cape. Deputy minister of justice and correctional services Thabang Makwetla said: &ldquo;A total of 33 inmates started attacking officials on duty. &ldquo;The offenders were carrying sharp objects and self-made knives. &ldquo;Thirteen officials were injured and six are in a critical condition in hospital.&rdquo; A prisoner told Daily Sun they stabbed warders to get the authorities&rsquo; attention. &ldquo;We are locked up in our cells all day without any chance to exercise, we don&rsquo;t get proper medical attention and we don&rsquo;t have access to rehabilitation programmes. &ldquo;Prison warders abuse us and swear at us,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We have sent many complaints to the office of the minister of correctional services but nothing has been done.&rdquo; However, Makwetla claimed all the prisoners&rsquo; grievances had been addressed. A 36-year-old woman told the SunTeam her brother was serving 18 years for robbery and her family had not been told whether he was one of the dead or injured. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s dead or alive. &ldquo;It makes me so nervous.&rdquo;
