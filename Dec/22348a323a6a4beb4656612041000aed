She underwent an operation, and surgeons inserted a metal plate into her injured leg.According to Celinah, the metal attracts electricity. The 44-year-old claimed she&rsquo;s suffered at least five powerful shocks by going too close to izinyoka connections. &ldquo;Where I live there are wires everywhere. I was even shocked in my own home.&ldquo;I need help before this thing kills me,&rdquo; said Celinah.&ldquo;Every time I pass those shacks with illegal izinyoka connections I keep my fingers crossed, because electricity follows me. &ldquo;When it rains it is worse.&ldquo;These wires are everywhere and I risk my life when I walk near them.&ldquo;I wish I didn&rsquo;t have this metal thing in my leg!&ldquo;Everybody knows about my problem and they always laugh at me.&rdquo; Celinah&rsquo;s friend Dimakatso Moeketsi (40) said she tries to walk with her friend whenever she can, but sometimes it is impossible.&ldquo;She is my friend and I worry because her situation is not good.&rdquo;
