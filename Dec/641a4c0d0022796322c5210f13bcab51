DIETITIAN Daddy Matthews said most men hate eating vegetables, not knowing that they help boost them sexually. He said women would also become sweeter if they ate more fruit from the marula tree. This emerged during the Indigenous Culinary Festival held at Jack Botes Park in Polokwane on Monday afternoon.Matthews reminded visitors of the importance of various types of food.He said: &ldquo;Indigenous food like traditional morogo gives the body vitamins A and zinc, helping men to perform well sexually. &ldquo;Mopani worms in your diet will provide protein and help your body grow well. The worms must be cooked until they are crispy.&rdquo; He said people suffer more from diabetes, hypertension, gout and arthritis since they have turned their backs on indigenous food.Matthews was joined on stage by chef Siba Mtongana from Food Network and Onicca Moloi, Limpopo&rsquo;s MEC for sport, arts and culture.Moloi is also a qualified chef.The panel shared recipes and cooking tips with the public.Moloi said the festival helps to fulfil the goal of the United Nations to provide a sustainable food supply in all countries and to end hunger. &ldquo;We aim to achieve food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.&ldquo;Indigenous food and fruit are generally organic, cheap and easily accessible. &ldquo;If people are taught about their nutritional value, the world will gradually get rid of hunger.&rdquo;
