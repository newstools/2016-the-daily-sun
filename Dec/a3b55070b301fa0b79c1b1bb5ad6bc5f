WHEN his manager allegedly promised him in front of a commissioner at the CCMA that he would get his job back after an internal discussion, he believed him.But the 39-year-old man from Osindisweni in Verulam, north of Durban, is now scratching his head. The company apparently moved to an unknown location without telling him.Bheki Mbizana told Daily Sun all his efforts to get justice have been in vain.Bheki claimed he was suspended on Friday 26 August after his manager at Umbilo, a security company, he knew as Umbilo Security Patrol Experts told him he was not doing his job properly.&ldquo;I knew that was not the case. So on 2 September I went straight to the CCMA to fight the suspension.&ldquo;When we met with the commissioner at the CCMA on 26 September, my manager requested me to come back to work so that we could iron things out internally,&rdquo; claimed Bheki.&ldquo;But when I went to my workplace, he said he was busy and promised to have me back for a meeting within a week.&rdquo;When his manager failed to call him back, Bheki went back to the office but was told by people who work in the same building that the company had moved to Amanzimtoti and left no forwarding address! &ldquo;I went back to the CCMA to report the matter but I was told that I needed to give them the address of the place before they could re-open the case.&ldquo;I want justice! &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pleading with the labour department to fight for me so that I can get my job back.&ldquo;If the company doesn&rsquo;t want that, they must give me a written letter stating that they have fired me so that I can claim my UIF money.&rdquo;The People&rsquo;s Paper tried to call the company several times with no luck.KZN labour department spokesman Lungelo Mkamba said: &ldquo;This is a dismissal case, therefore it should be referred to the CCMA as it falls within their jurisdiction.&rdquo; CCMA national spokeswoman Lusanda Myoli said: &ldquo;We will be in a position to advise the complainant once I have feedback on the status of this case.&rdquo;
