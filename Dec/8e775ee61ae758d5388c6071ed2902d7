A MAN has described how another man, allegedly Mark Scott-Crossley, suddenly grabbed and smashed his cellphone and then repeatedly drove over him in an apparent racist attack.&ldquo;I am fighting for my life at the moment,&rdquo; Silence Mabunda, 37, general worker at Moholoholo Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre, told News24 today from his hospital bed in Nelspruit.&ldquo;He switched on his headlights which blinded me a bit. I tried to jump out of the way, but he was coming on too fast and knocked me over," he said, describing what happened.&ldquo;He drove over me and then reversed. He drove over me twice and then just drove away.&rdquo;Scott-Crossley made international headlines in 2004 when he was tried and convicted for the murder of a worker he threw into a lion enclosure.He was released on parole in 2008.The attack on Mabunda happened in Hoedspruit last Wednesday evening.In a phone interview from Rob Ferreira Public Hospital in Nelspruit, Mabunda said that he bought airtime at a shop when a man approached him.&nbsp; &ldquo;As I was leaving the shop my phone started to ring. Answering my phone, a white guy smashed it to the ground. The cover and screen broke,&rdquo; Mabunda said.There were other men present who apparently identified the man as Scott-Crossley, by using his first name and part of his surname.&ldquo;Two other white guys tried to stop him and asked &lsquo;Mark Scott why did you do it?&rsquo; Mark said: &lsquo;Because I don&rsquo;t like black people.&rsquo;&ldquo;I also asked him why he did it and he said: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me like that, ek sal jou bliksem (I will hit you).&rsquo;&rdquo;Mabunda said that as he was heading back to work shortly after the incident outside the shop, the same man in a car neared him.&ldquo;Around 7pm, a car was driving slowly next to me. I quickly realised that the guy in the car is the one who broke my phone,&rdquo; he said.The driver turned the car around and it headed straight towards Mabunda.After Mabunda was hit, and after the car drove over him, Mabunda asked someone nearby to phone the ambulance.&ldquo;At the time I didn&rsquo;t feel anything,&rdquo; Mabunda said.But today he said: "What I can tell you is that my whole body is paining.&rdquo;Limpopo cop spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo told News 24 that a warrant of arrest for Scott-Crossley was issued on Wednesday.Police are yet to make an arrest and have urged anyone with information about Scott-Crossley's whereabouts to contact the Hoedspruit police station on 015 779 4063.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/he-drove-over-me-twice-worker-attacked-allegedy-by-mark-scott-crossley-20161222&nbsp;
