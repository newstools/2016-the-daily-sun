MINISTER in the Presidency Jeff Radebe says government needs to strengthen partnerships with the private sector to help the economy grow. Radebe was speaking on Thursday at the KZN Growth and Coalition workshop held in Zimbali resort, north of Durban.He said although KZN has worked hard to grow the economy in the province, it has not yet fully exposed its rich tourism industry.&ldquo;We should focus more on tourism. We need to expose our tourist attractions to outside countries. &ldquo;Businesses and government need to work together to sort this out because this province can get lots of money from tourists.&rdquo;The minister added that business people must always grab these kinds of opportunities.&ldquo;Government cannot win any battles without help from different sectors. You must also remember that as business people, you have responsibilities to create employment, improve our infrastructures and fight crime.&rdquo; MEC for economic development, tourism and environmental affairs Sihle Zikalala &ndash; who doubles as the acting premier &ndash; attended the event. &ldquo;I believe that this workshop will yield good results. If we continue to work together as a province, we will reach where we want to be. The future is bright for this country,&rdquo; said Zikalala.Zandile Khubisa (54) who owns a wholesale in Nkobongo, KwaDukuza, said this is the perfect platform to network with other business people and government.&ldquo;We need help too in order to help the government. We also play a big role in creating jobs in our areas,&rdquo; she said.
