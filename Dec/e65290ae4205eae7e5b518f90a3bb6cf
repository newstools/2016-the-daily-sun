MANY mashonisas charge very high interest rates and when customers can&rsquo;t pay, they take their IDs or Sassa cards. This practice is illegal. And on Monday three mashonisas were bust withdrawing money from 30 Sassa cards at an ATM in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni. Captain Jethro Mtshali, Kempton Park police spokesman, said members of the Benoni flying squad were called to Emperors Palace by an alert security officer who noticed two women and one man drawing cash at the ATM using different cards.&ldquo;The officers drove to the scene and found the suspects. They were searched and 30 Sassa debit cards were found in their possession along with a large amount of cash.&rdquo; He said after they were questioned, the suspects could not give a proper explanation for why they had the debit cards of so many different account-holders.&ldquo;Police have not established how the three suspects got hold of the pins.&rdquo; Mtshali said the three suspects aged between 31 and 36 were due to appear in the Kempton Park Magistrates Court yesterday on charges of possession of suspected stolen goods. Mtshali warned members of the public not to give their Sassa or bank cards to anyone they don&rsquo;t know.
