WHENEVER Palesa complained about a known drug dealer, her mum gave the same advice: &ldquo;Try to avoid bumping into him as much as possible, my child.&rdquo; For weeks it worked as Palesa Ramagaga (16) steered clear of him but on 6 October, Palesa went missing. Her decomposing body was found three days later and her body showed signs that she had been sexually assaulted and strangled.Cathrine Ramagaga (50) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;My daughter lived in fear of this man who grabbed her in the street, demanding she be his girlfriend. &ldquo;She always told him that she was way too young, but he insisted all the same.&rdquo;On 6 October, while Cathrine was attending night classes, she got a call from Palesa asking to tag along with neighbours to night prayers at a local church. Cathrine agreed.&ldquo;I returned home and got some sleep, but woke up at about 10.30pm. &ldquo;I went to Palesa&rsquo;s room to check on her, and was shocked to discover that she had still not returned.&rdquo;Cathrine called the neighbours but the last time they saw her was when they returned from church at about 8.30pm and bade Palesa farewell at the gate of her yard. Xolani Mabena (26) has been asked to contact Detective-Captain Dan Mkhonto on 082 375 3351, to assist the police in their investigation into Palesa&rsquo;s death.
