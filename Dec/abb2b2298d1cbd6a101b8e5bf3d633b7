ORLANDO Pirates management will decide next week whether to retain Augusto Palacios as caretaker coach or not.Palacios seems to have had enough of his players&rsquo; lack of discipline and desire to fight for the club hardly two months after he replaced Muhsin Ertugral. He accused his players of lacking fighting spirit following their 2-1 defeat to Bloemfontein Celtic in their last Absa Premiership match of the year at Orlando Stadium. It was Palacios second successive league defeat having lost by the same margin to Maritzburg United prior to that encounter. Ironically, Ertugral resigned due to a similar situation which saw his charges suffer a humiliating 6-1 league defeat to SuperSport United. Pirates currently occupy 10th position on the Premiership table with 18 points from 13 matches.Bucs official Floyd Mbele said: &ldquo;The club is still on festive break and management will decide the way forward next week.&rdquo; SunSport has however reliably learnt that Bucs management will get to the root of the problem and curb ill discipline in the team to avoid a recurring incident that shocked Palacios. The outspoken mentor knows that he will need their intervention if he hopes to repeat a similar performance which saw him guide the club to the league title in 2011-12 season. Said a source: &ldquo;Lack of discipline is the first priority for management to resolve before they decide on a coach. They don&rsquo;t want to bring a new coach on board only to have the same problems that Palacios pointed out.&rdquo;The Bucs coaching job is the most difficult in the PSL as no coach has lasted longer than 20 months since the departure of Ruud Krol, who won the treble in 2011. The Soweto giants have had seven coaches in the last six years.
