THE Mokgatlhe family was asleep when they heard a knock on their door. They were surprised to find a woman with a baby on their doorstep, asking for a place to sleep for the night. Tito Mokgatlhe (39) and his family always try to help others, so they welcomed the mum and her nine-month-old baby girl inside. But now the mum has vanished and left the baby with them! This happened on Friday in Kagiso, Mogale City.Tito said he&rsquo;s worried something bad might have happened to the mum. She was only known to the family as Dineo and she left to withdraw money at the bank to buy food for baby Amogelang. Tito said the baby needs her mum and is asking SunReaders to help find her.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried about the baby&rsquo;s wellbeing as I don&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s supposed to eat and what not to eat. Things are tough here. I rely on part-time jobs to make a living but I haven&rsquo;t been going out because I have to take care of the baby.&ldquo;The baby is crying when she wakes up and we don&rsquo;t know what to do. I feel sorry for her because she is the one suffering. She has no fresh clothes or milk.&rdquo; Tito said he went to Kagiso cop shop to seek help and was referred to social workers, who promised to assist him.
