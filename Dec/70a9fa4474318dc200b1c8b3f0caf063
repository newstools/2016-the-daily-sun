He said our Constitution is admired all over the world.&ldquo;The Constitution is the supreme law of the land. All laws passed by Parliament must be in line with it.&ldquo;Our courts are the trusted final arbiters of disputes in society. &ldquo;To maintain this role, our judiciary needs to jealously safeguard the Constitution&rsquo;s dignity, accessibility, impartiality and independence.&rdquo; He urged members of the public to use Chapter 9 institutions as they were there to assist them.Also on Saturday, DA leader Mmusi Maimane said in Cape Town that Zuma and the ANC have abandoned the constitutional goal of serving the people in favour of serving themselves.He said it is a shame that Zuma, who gets his authority from the Constitution, has been found to have undermined and violated that which he swore to protect, uphold and defend. &ldquo;The drafters of the highest law in the land never foresaw that such a compromised and corrupt individual would be entrusted with bringing the Constitution to life,&rdquo; Maimane said.
