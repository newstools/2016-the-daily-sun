ALL the little girl wanted was an ice lolly but she ended up getting hot klaps and being treated like a slave!&nbsp; The nine-year-old&rsquo;s gogo, Thokozile Shiburi, is now demanding justice for the child, who she said was treated badly by a neighbour.&nbsp; According to the 52-year-old gogo from Emoyeni in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, her granddaughter excitedly left home on Thursday to go and buy ice lollies, but she returned much later crying and with wet hands.&nbsp; Thokozile said the girl told her she had picked up a peach that had fallen from the neighbour&rsquo;s tree and she was made to do the washing as punishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;She left at about 10am. When she didn&rsquo;t come back we thought she was playing with her friends. &ldquo;Little did we know that she was being used as a slave at that house,&rdquo; Thokozile said.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are still shocked by the incident. She told me she did take a peach but it had fallen from the tree.&nbsp; &ldquo;The woman caught her and took her into her house, where she beat her and made her wash clothes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thokozile said she tried to open a case but the police told her all she could do was get a protection order.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are now stuck with a protection order that will never help us,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; The SunTeam visited the neighbour&rsquo;s home and knocked on the gate for a long time, but no one answered. Constable Patricia Mngijima from the Rabasotho Police Station advised the family to return to the cop shop to formally open a case.&nbsp; &ldquo;The incident is clearly related to child abuse. &ldquo;We advise the family to open a case so that the police can investigate,&rdquo; she said.
