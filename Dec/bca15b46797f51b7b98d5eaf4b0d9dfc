SINGER Msaki, real name Asanda Lusaseni-Mvana, is celebrating a double dose of blessings!The Indie-folk singer&rsquo;s career is flourishing and she&rsquo;s an expectant mum.The velvety-voiced singer and songwriter from East London, in the Eastern Cape, showed her baby bump recently at The Theatre on the Track, in Kyalami, Joburg.A source said: &ldquo;She was part of the Simphiwe Dana Symphony Experience, which featured some of her musical friends &ndash; Asa and Buika. When Msaki walked on stage, her baby bump was visible.&rdquo;&ldquo;She wore a baggy outfit, but it was too hard to cover up the pregnancy.&rdquo; Another source said Msaki has had a great year as she was also a recipient at this year&rsquo;s Standard Bank Ovation Awards.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re moving with the times in terms of women in the creative world no longer having to put their careers on hold to start their own families . It was a big pat on the back for Msaki to feature on Simphiwe Dana&rsquo;s show, as this has introduced her to a new audience. Especially since the show was recorded on DVD. I wish her all the best with her career,&rdquo; said a second source.She also launched her album, Zaneliza: How the Water Moves, in collaboration with the Golden Circle, at Soweto Theatre, a few weeks ago.Msaki is well-known in the Eastern Cape and has performed at the Grahamstown National Arts Festival and the East London Arts Festival.Said Msaki: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a good year! It&rsquo;s a natural thing for a woman to fall pregnant, but because we carry babies we get asked about it, as opposed to the fathers who are also in the entertainment industry . I&rsquo;ll take a short break after the baby arrives. But I have so many plans for next year.&rdquo;
