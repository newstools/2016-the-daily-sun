IT WAS in the early hours of Saturday morning when residents woke to the sounds of screaming outside their houses.Too afraid to go out into the dark, they let the matter rest and went back to sleep. When the sun rose, they found that a man had been stabbed to death, apparently for his shoes.Residents of Boitumelo, a small kasi in the Vaal, said this happened every year as the festive season approached.&ldquo;More and more residents visit taverns for nights of boozing at this time of the year.&ldquo;Like many other residents, I believe the murdered man was stumbling home from a tavern. He was robbed of his shoes and other belongings before being stabbed to death,&rdquo; said one resident.The unknown victim, a man believed to be in his 30s, was killed in a small passage between two houses in the area.His shoes were missing and his bloodied white T-shirt had several holes, suggesting he had been brutally stabbed.Paramedics were called to the scene and declared the victim dead soon after arriving. Cops started the difficult process of trying to identify the dead man.Residents at the scene told Daily Sun they had heard screaming in the early hours of the morning but feared for their safety and didn&rsquo;t go out to investigate.&ldquo;I first heard noises outside and soon afterwards, screams. &ldquo;My husband and I wanted to go out and see what was happening but we were afraid that whoever was out there might be thugs armed with guns so we stayed inside,&rdquo; said one of the neighbours.Police spokesman Captain Teboho Lephoto asked residents who might have any information to come forward.
