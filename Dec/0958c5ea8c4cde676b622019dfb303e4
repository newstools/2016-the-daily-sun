LUCY SAID she treated her husband Joseph like a king for 21 years. She can&rsquo;t understand why Joseph has married a much younger woman without even letting her know. BUT JOSEPH EXPLAINED: I CAN&rsquo;T SLEEP WITH A WOMAN FOR SIX YEARS AND NEVER HAVE SEX! &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore,&rdquo; said Joseph Mkhondo (63),&nbsp;who got married last Saturday and now lives with his new wife in Jane Furse, Limpopo. He claims his wife has refused to have sex for the last six years, while sharing the same blanket and the same bed. He said he is now the happiest person on earth. &ldquo;I love my first wife very much but I am a man and I have needs.&rdquo; He said he was forced to have another relationship and this younger woman completes him by giving him what a man wants. But Lucy Mkhondo (53), Joseph&rsquo;s first wife, told Daily Sun she didn&rsquo;t know her husband was making wedding arrangements. &ldquo;My friends told me my husband was walking down the aisle with a woman in a big white wedding dress.&rdquo; Lucy said she was devastated and heartbroken after she discovered her husband of 21 years got married to a younger woman behind her back. Lucy and Joseph met in 1981 and have seven children, all over 18. &ldquo;He was pure and I was a virgin. We fell in love and got married in 1991. He is the one and only man I have ever slept with. &ldquo;I gave this man the best years of my life and this is the reward I get,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How can he get married to someone else without divorcing me first? &ldquo;I have a marriage certificate to prove we are still married.&rdquo; Joseph said: &ldquo;I am a grown man. According to my culture I&rsquo;m allowed to take a second wife. I love them both very much. &ldquo;I still take care of my first wife and children. They live in the house I pay rent for.&rdquo; Daily Sun spoke to the new wife, Olga Maputle. &ldquo;I know he has a first wife but I do not want to talk about it. &ldquo;If you want answers, you must talk to my husband,&rdquo; she said.
