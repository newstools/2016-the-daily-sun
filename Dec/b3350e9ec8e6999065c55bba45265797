A FAMILY of 11 are living on top of each other in a two-roomed house.None of the adults have jobs and three of them are disabled.Ntombizodwa Ngubane (52) from Mfazazane Village in Mzumbe, southern KZN has a mentally ill son (23) and a blind daughter (32). Also living in the house are her disabled cousin Mthembeni Gama (52), four children and three grandkids.Ntombizodwa said only her daughter and cousin receive disability grants, which they all survive on. Her mentally ill son refuses to go and see a doctor so that his disability grant can be approved.&ldquo;I cannot work because I have to look after my daughter who is totally blind. She can&rsquo;t do anything for herself,&rdquo; said Ntombizodwa. She said the two disability grants only cover their medicine and monthly groceries.Her sons dropped out of school to go and look for piece jobs because she couldn&rsquo;t survive.&ldquo;Our biggest problem is that we&rsquo;re squashed in this two-roomed house that is too small,&rdquo; she said.Mthembeni said the family applied for an RDP in 2014 and received a visit from people who claimed they were sent by the councillor, but they are still waiting. &ldquo;We get water from neighbours because we can&rsquo;t afford the R3 000 you need if you want a tap in your yard,&rdquo; he said.Councillor Phumzile Habile said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re working on the matter to try and help them.&rdquo;Social development spokeswoman Ncumisa Ndelu said the family would have to get the disabled son to a doctor for him to be assessed for a disability grant.
