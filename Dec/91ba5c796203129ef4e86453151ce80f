SUNPOWER has done it again!This time the People&rsquo;s Paper came to the rescue of soon-to-be mum of three, Johanna Sekopane (24) of Cullinan. Johanna can enjoy her pregnancy after surgeons finally mended her burst stitches from her previous caesarean operations.Johanna had twice given birth via caesarean section and is now pregnant with her third child, but as soon as her tummy started showing, her stitches became a problem. The stitches from her previous caesarean operation burst open and started to bleed, and the scared mum rushed to Mamelodi Day Hospital for help last month.The doctor who examined her apparently said that it was only a small problem and sent Johanna to Refilwe Clinic where the wound was dressed. But after just a few days the wound started bleeding again and the area began to swell.Unable to bear the pain, Johanna went back to the hospital where she was allegedly told to go home and wait for her time to deliver. It was only after Daily Sun intervened that she was taken to theatre and the problem was properly taken care of.Johanna was operated on last Tuesday and discharged on Thursday. Steve Mabona, Gauteng Health Department spokesman, said Johanna received treatment from two doctors who saw her on 28 and 30 November.
