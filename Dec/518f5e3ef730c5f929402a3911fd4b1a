SOUTH Africa&rsquo;s Under-20 team registered the biggest win in SA&rsquo;s national soccer history when they trashed Lesotho 8-0 in their opening match of the Cosafa Cup on Wednesday.Amajita have thrown down the gauntlet, showing they intend to defend their title. They will be up against Swaziland next in a potential Group A decider at Moruleng Stadium today (2pm). Swaziland defeated Botswana 2-0 in their opening match. Amajita aim to use this competition to prepare for the Under-20 Africa Cup of Nations in Zambia in February next year. Coach Thabo Senong says he is impressed with their start but there are some aspects they need to improve.He said: &ldquo;The score was not a true reflexion of the game. I believe if we were playing a stronger team they might have punished us. There&rsquo;s still some work to do. &ldquo;We lose possession in our own half and our decision-making is not up to scratch in transition situations. &ldquo;Our objective is to try different combinations to see if we are technically and physically ready for Zambia.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy with what I have seen in our first match. Some of the players were playing their first game for this team and they did well. &ldquo;We will need to stay grounded ahead of the next fixture against Swaziland, not get carried away but maintain consistency.&rdquo;Senong knows Swaziland&rsquo;s strengths and is hoping his charges will be able to match them.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m expecting a different ball game against Swaziland. Swaziland have tall, quick players and they are strong. &ldquo;Physically, it&rsquo;s going to be a tough game. But I&rsquo;m confident we will get maximum points to make sure we stay on top of our group,&rdquo; said Senong. Amajita go into this game leading Group A on three points, equal on points with Swaziland. They are separated by goal difference. The team finishing at the top in the respective groups will go through to the semifinals.
