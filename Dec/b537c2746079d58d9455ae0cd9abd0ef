THE tombstone left on the side of the road near Philani Valley Mall in Umlazi, south of Durban has been broken. It was destroyed on Saturday by street vendors and patrons from a nearby tavern. The vendors told Daily Sun the stone brought their businesses bad luck. The engraved grey stone was left there last Monday. According to the dates engraved on it, it belonged to a person who was born on 5 May 1934 and died on 7 December 2013.The People&rsquo;s Paper published the story about the mystery stone on Thursday. Hawker Zamo Mbambo (34) told the SunTeam they decided to break it because it was scaring their customers away.&ldquo;The stone was left there on Monday. When I arrived at my stall that day, it was already there at 7am. Other hawkers did not know how it got there or who left it.&ldquo;My customers were complaining that it was a sign of bad luck.&rdquo;Zamo said the hawkers whose tables are next to the busy mall had a meeting on Saturday morning. &ldquo;We decided to break it up it because we did not know who left it there and suspected witchcraft. &ldquo;How could someone just leave a tombstone on the side of the road? We owed it to our customers to destroy it,&rdquo; he said, adding that they used stones to break it.A patron from the nearby tavern said: &ldquo;We suspected the stone was left there by someone evil. We wanted to show them we aren&rsquo;t scared of their rituals.&rdquo;When the SunTeam arrived at the scene the cross next to the stone had been destroyed and the top of the stone vandalised.
