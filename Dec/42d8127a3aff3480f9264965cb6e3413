THE two brothers were very happy when Gauteng Premier David Makhura handed over a house to them two weeks ago. But their joy was spoiled on Sunday when thugs came into the house in Winterveld, Tshwane during the night and stole their furniture and groceries! Makhura gave Peter Mothewane (60), and his brother Thomas Mothewane (40), the house after meeting them while canvassing during the local government elections. The brothers have been sleeping in shacks in the yard since receiving the house because it had not yet been electrified, which meant they didn&rsquo;t wake up when the thugs struck. Peter said they were shocked when they woke up on Monday morning to find a window broken and everything in the house stolen.The thugs stole new sofas, two double-beds, a coffee table, new pots, a fridge, microwave oven, a new kettle, bedding, clothes and groceries.&ldquo;I immediately ran to wake my brother in his shack. When we got to the door of the house, it was wide open,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;All our furniture was gone. When we checked the bedrooms we found the thugs had even stolen our double beds and all our clothes.&rdquo; Peter said what angered him most was that the heartless thugs even took their food, which was supposed to last them until the end of next month. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where we are going to find food for the rest of the month now.&rdquo; Police spokesman Captain Samuel Sebola said cases of housebreaking and theft were opened, but no arrests have been made yet.
