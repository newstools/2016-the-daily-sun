STEALING AND slaughtering the cows seemed like a good idea &ndash; until the owner caught the thug with the raw meat.&nbsp; Isaac taught the man a lesson right there where the cows were being slaughtered.&nbsp; YOU STEAL THE MEAT, YOU EAT COWS&rsquo; FEET, HE SAID. Not only was the thug forced to chew raw cow heels, he was made to lie on top of the raw, stinking, uncleaned intestines.Early yesterday morning, Isaac Mashinini (62) noticed that the fence of his kraal in Block XX, Soshanguve, Tshwane was broken. Isaac, owner of the cattle and a former martial arts teacher, said he knew something was wrong.&ldquo;I called my brother, Abram (50), so we could investigate what was going on,&rdquo; he told Daily Sun.&ldquo;As I expected, my two cows had been stolen.&rdquo;Other farmers in the area joined Isaac and Abram as they searched the veld in Winterveld but they eventually found the cows &ndash; or what was left of them &ndash; in the bush in Soshanguve. According to Isaac, they saw two suspicious looking men who tried to run away when they saw Isaac and his brother.&ldquo;We chased them. One got away but we caught the other one,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;There was cow tripe, intestines and heels lying everywhere.&rdquo;The thug confessed to stealing and slaughtering the cows.&ldquo;He told us he was with his friend and he showed us where the meat was hidden, in a trench near the main road. &ldquo;He said they were waiting for a bakkie which was supposed to come and collect it.&rdquo;The thug said it was the first time he was involved in stealing cows but residents said he was a usual suspect in many crimes committed in the area.They attacked the thug before calling the cops.While waiting for the police, the beating stopped but the man was made to lie on top of his loot and chew on cows heels at the same time.A resident asked the police to hand the man to them so that he could be killed as a lesson to other would-be thugs in the area. Akasia police spokeswoman, Constable Zanele Mtshweni said police attended the scene but no case was opened.Isaac said they let the man go because he had dealt with him.
