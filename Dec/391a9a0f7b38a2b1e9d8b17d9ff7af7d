SYLEENA JOHNSON is coming to Mzansi!The I&rsquo;m Your Woman hitmaker is headed here for the second time in a year.And fans can&rsquo;t wait for the Grammy-winning, R&amp;B and soul diva.Syleena is one of two international artists performing at the 5th Annual Ebubeleni Music Festival in the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality. She&rsquo;ll share the stage with her compatriot, Monique Bingham.Organisers say this year&rsquo;s gig will happen on 30 December.Project manager of the event, Marc Mahambehlala, said the festival had and needed a bigger venue.&ldquo;Unlike previous years, when we staged the event at a cricket stadium, this year it&rsquo;ll be held at Scribante Racetrack to accommodate more people,&rdquo; Marc said.&ldquo;This year we&rsquo;re expecting more than 18 000 people as the place is a lot bigger. And no cops will force us to end the show before time.&rdquo;About the kind of music to be played on the day, Marc said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a family affair, so all types of music will be played. We&rsquo;re happy with Syleena as she&rsquo;s not bringing her own band along. She&rsquo;ll be performing with a local band.&ldquo;Our aim is to empower our local artists. There have been complaints that we value international musicians more than our own.&ldquo;Syleena has already sent her music for the band to rehearse. She&rsquo;ll arrive three days before the show &ndash; and will meet the band,&rdquo; said Marc.The line-up is made up of well-known artists and young ones who are making a name for themselves. It includes Mafikizolo, Tsepo Tshola, Ringo Madlingozi, TiMO ODV, Musa, Fifi Cooper, Emtee, Babes Wodumo, Vusi Nova, Phinda Matlala DJ SPHEctacula &amp; Naves and NaakMusiQ.Daily Sun and Sunday Sun are the media partners of the festival.
