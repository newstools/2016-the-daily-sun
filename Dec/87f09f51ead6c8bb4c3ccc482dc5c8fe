RESIDENTS are furious because they claim the cops took the weekend off! People from KwaMashu, north of Durban told Daily Sun they were shocked when they found the charge office empty on Friday. One resident said when they arrived to open a case at 5.20pm, a cop on her way out told them to wait for the night shift. When the SunTeam visited at 5.31pm, the office was completely empty. The People&rsquo;s Paper witnessed cops arriving shortly after 6pm and shouting at residents, accusing them of thinking they were special.Apparently, they were angry that residents had complained to their superiors. One man who arrived at 5.30pm to open a case said he had to wait for a whole hour before being helped. When the SunTeam visited the station again on Monday afternoon, cops were relaxing and told residents to wait for the night shift to open cases. One man said he was told to wait to open an assault case. &ldquo;A woman cop told me if she helped me she would have to knock off later than usual. &ldquo;She said opening a case takes too long.&rdquo; KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said they checked with the KwaMashu SAPS and there was no shortage of staff over the weekend. &ldquo;There is enough manpower at the charge office and also at the malls. Members are set up to control any criminal activity. &ldquo;The community service centre operates 24 hours a day.&ldquo;We appeal to complainants to visit the station commander so an internal investigation can be conducted,&rdquo; Gwala said.
