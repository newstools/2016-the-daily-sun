THE Dhlamini family from KwaMdakane, KZN, has been blessed with a new house! The family of 10 used to live in a small room that only contained a single bed and stove! After a long struggle, a Good Samaritan, Teddy Nyathi, came to the family&rsquo;s rescue. Teddy, of MoonJam Incredible, said he was approached by the community to help the struggling family. The family&rsquo;s one room was flooded with water every time it rained but they had nowhere to go.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m from this area and I was contacted mainly by the youth who asked me to lend a helping hand, and I obliged. &ldquo;At first, I planned to build them a two-roomed house but I realised it was not good enough. I got my partners to chip in and that is how we ended up with seven rooms,&rdquo; said Teddy.The new house was built next to the old one, and has three bedrooms, a bathroom, a fully equipped kitchen and a lounge. &ldquo;My team and I also decided to open a laundromat business for the family in order for them to be able to maintain themselves,&rdquo; said Teddy.Emotional Sibongile Dhlamini (51) said she was grateful to her community and Teddy.&ldquo;My children will finally live in comfort for the first time in their lives. &ldquo;I would like to thank the community for dedicating their time to building my home, especially the youth, who were there every step of the way. &ldquo;I pray that God blesses Mr Nyathi with more wealth. I am not the first one that he has built a house for.&rdquo;Teddy told Daily Sun it&rsquo;s important to give back to the community once you succeed in life. Among the guests who attended the event this week were celebrities Sophie Ndaba, Dudu Khoza, DJ Sihle Mngadi of Ukhozi FM and King Zwelithini&rsquo;s brothers. The celebration later continued with a concert with performances by Babes Wodumo and DJ Tira.
