THE CCTV cameras are a waste of time and money.This was the reaction of residents of Glebelands Hostel after eThekwini Municipality approved a R3 million budget on Thursday. The budget is for the phase two installation of CCTV cameras at the hostel.Vanessa Burger of Ubunye bamaHostela said the authorities know very well that installing CCTV cameras in hostel does nothing to stop the violence.&ldquo;This project shows how morally bankrupt this regime has become. It uses every opportunity to make money from poor peoples&rsquo; blood instead of taking the steps it knows are needed to end the killing. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know of one case where the cameras led to an arrest, much less a conviction. There is no need for costly cameras, fences, private security, and bodyguards for the councillors,&rdquo; said Burger.She mentioned about eight incidents in areas where there are CCTV cameras. She said ANC Councillor Zodwa Sibiya was shot dead on 16 April at Block L with a camera facing the scene. She said a Block O resident was attacked by four gunmen in front of a camera but there have been no arrests.Burger said all that is needed was a functioning justice system free of political interference.She said the project was yet another tactic to make money from tenders and contracts which are awarded to politically connected people.eThekwini spokeswoman Tozi Mthethwa said the installation of the cameras would go a long way to ensure the safety of hostel residents. She did not reply to an email sent to her regarding the allegations made by Burger.
