ZAMA ZAMAS are at each other&rsquo;s throats as they rush for gold. Yesterday, residents watched in horror as a man&rsquo;s lifeless body was brought to the surface at the Roodepoort mine known as Marikana.It is alleged the fight was over gold.A resident told Daily Sun they live in fear as deaths in the area are increasing. Another resident, Siyabonga Mkhize (28), said: &ldquo;The situation is bad and it is going to get worse. &ldquo;The zama zamas want to make a lot of money so they can show off when they get to their home towns. &ldquo;Greed is what causes them to kill each other and it&rsquo;s sad because none of them own that gold. They are all stealing it.&rdquo; He added that someone always ends up dead in the end. &ldquo;These people fight for territory while underground. &ldquo;One team might lose while in the mine but revenge will be sought once they resurface,&rdquo; said Siyabonga.He said the fight started with an argument and then gun shots were fired. &ldquo;The shooter managed to flee the scene because he threatened to shoot residents who wanted to give chase.&rdquo;Captain Solomon Sibiya confirmed that police are investigating a case of murder. He said no one has been bust and cops ask people with information to report to their nearest police station.
