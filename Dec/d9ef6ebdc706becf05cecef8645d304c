HE WENT out with his friend on Sunday for a good time and a few drinks at the local tavern. But it was a mistake as his evil friend had other plans for him!According to Sabata Tlali, he was drugged, kidnapped and taken to an initiation school against his will! The 36-year-old from Rosendal in the Free State said he tried to tell the initiation school&rsquo;s teacher he was not supposed to be there but he was beaten with sticks. To make matters worse, he was allegedly tied to a horse and dragged while one of the teachers rode the animal! Sabata&rsquo;s mum, Mamothibeli (69) said she became very worried when he never came home. &ldquo;Before we even had a chance to report him missing with the cops the following day, a teacher from the initiation school phoned to say Sabata was there. &ldquo;I called the initiation school committee and complained. He was sent home full of blood and scars.&rdquo; Sabata said he was lucky to be rescued by cops and initiation school committee members. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very disappointed by what my friend did to me,&rdquo; he said. Police spokesman, Captain Phumelelo Dhlamini said three men, aged between 27 and 49, were arrested. &ldquo;A case of assault GBH was opened and the school was closed down. The initiates were sent to a registered school.&rdquo;
