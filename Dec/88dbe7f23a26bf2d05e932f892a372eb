WATER is a precious resource but some people don&rsquo;t seem to care! Every day, thousands of litres of drinking water flow down the main road in Duveledza Village, Limpopo. Motorists driving through the village near Thohoyandou are greeted by two broken communal taps that leak non-stop. Residents said the taps have been leaking for a month. Villagers claim they reported the problem to the Vhembe Municipality but are still waiting for a response. Victor Ndou (45), a villager, said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve tried many times to fix the taps ourselves, but lost the battle. Our greatest fear is that we will end up like other villages which have been without running water for months.&ldquo;We are appealing to the municipality to fix the problem before our communal taps run dry.&rdquo; Municipal spokesman Moses Shivambu told Daily Sun: &ldquo;The problem was never reported to us by the community members. &ldquo;However, we will do our best to make sure a technical team is sent to the affected area. &ldquo;We also like to appeal to the community to report this type of problem immediately. Wasted water can never be replaced.&rdquo;
