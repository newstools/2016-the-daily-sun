Accompanied by Councillor Sipho Maselane, they launched a massive manhunt for the thugs and recovered the stolen items! Daily Sun published the story yesterday about how heartless thugs on Christmas Day cleaned out the house in Winterveld, Tshwane. The house was handed over to the brothers by Gauteng Premier David Makhura earlier this month. Resident Fututu Ntuli (52) said they heard a man had bought a fridge from a woman in the area. &ldquo;We went to the man and he took us to where he had bought the fridge. At the house, we found some of the other stolen furniture.&rdquo; The woman who owns the house told the angry mob she was approached by two men who asked her to keep the goods and find customers for them. Fututu said the woman took residents to one of the men but he fled when he saw them approaching. &ldquo;We found out he was sleeping on one of the stolen beds and we took that back as well.&rdquo; She said they carried the furniture to the Mothewane brothers&rsquo; house and took the woman to Loate Police Station,but officers refused to open a case. However, Peter praised residents for recovering their belongings. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy they found the furniture even though our groceries are gone. After the break-in we weren&rsquo;t feeling safe but the community has made us trust the area again.&rdquo; Police spokesman Captain Samuel Sebola promised to investigate why the woman was not arrested when residents brought her in. &ldquo;A case of housebreaking and theft was opened and police will investigate further.&rdquo;
