NUMSA has not joined the chorus demanding that President Jacob Zuma be replaced by deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa. The secretary of the union, Irvin Jim, announced this in Joburg yesterday ahead of Numsa&rsquo;s national congress next week.Speaking about Ramaphosa, he said: &ldquo;Numsa can never support a capitalist exploiter seeking to protect his own huge investments and the interests of white monopoly capital. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying to send a message to the monopoly capitalist rating agencies that the South African economy will continue to be based on the free market and the exploitation of black and African labour so the country is not downgraded.&rdquo; Jim said Ramaphosa was portrayed as a representative of clean, constitutional and honest capitalism but, like the DA, he would ensure everything remained the same. Jim also warned that unless the horrible conditions members of the black working class lived in were attended to, the country was heading for violent class and racial confrontation.Numsa will be holding its 10th congress between Monday and Thursday in Cape Town next week.
