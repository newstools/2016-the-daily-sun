IT HAS been a stellar first round in the National First Division!Thanda Royal Zulu&rsquo;s 15 match unbeaten run, four of the five Cape Town teams struggling to make an impact, six coaches being sacked within 10 matches, and Mhlengi Cele and Sedwyn George raising their hands for the Golden Boot left supporters with much to talk about.Log leaders Thanda will be hoping that their first round unbeaten record helps prepare them for the second round.Amabhubesi, who were relegated to the NFD during the 2008-2009 season, this year turned out to be a team to beat in the NFD. Last season the Richards Bay-based outfit was among the teams fighting relegation, but their 1-1 draw against Moroka Swallows in their second last match of the season at Dobsonville Stadium on 15 May gave them another life. Now they are proving to be a force to be reckoned with. Under head coach Roger Sikhakhane who joined them towards the end of last season, they&rsquo;ve been marvellous to watch as they are playing exciting football and producing lots of goals.In the first 15 matches they have collected 35 points which saw them going to the Christmas recess sitting comfortably on top of the log, 10 points clear above second placed Royal Eagles.Thanda however are second best when it comes to scoring with their 30 goals lagging four behind Eagles&rsquo; 34. Thanda are also not the only KZN team that has been doing well, with neighbours Eagles who are under the watchful eye of Serbian mentor Kosta Papic also in top form. As things stand now we could see two KZN teams getting promoted to the Absa Premiership at the end of the season, not forgetting AmaZulu who showed some improvements in their last three games before the break.Cape Town, who many thought would dominate the league this season having five teams plying their trade in the NFD, had nothing to cheer about as their teams didn&rsquo;t produce any good results, except for Stellenbosch FC &ndash; formally known as Vasco Da Gama &ndash; who are in the top eight.FC Cape Town, Milano United, Cape Town All Stars and former PSL champions Santos had a first round to forget as they were struggling to get points. These four teams are occupying 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th positions respectively. With less than 10 games played in the first round, six coaches had also been shown the door by their teams. Cape-based All Stars, who had already parted ways with two coaches, were the first to fire Mlungisi &ldquo;Professor&rdquo; Ngubane after just three games.Ngubane was then replaced by former Kaizer Chiefs and Malawian defender Patrick Mabedi, who resigned after two weeks with the club.Zeca Marques (Santos), Vusi Mkhatshwa (Mbombela United), Jairos Tapera (Black Leopards) and Jacky Ledwaba (Magesi FC) are the other coaches who left their respective clubs in the first round.Cele of Thanda and George of Eagles have found the back of the net week in and week out and are the top scorers in the league with 12 goals each.
