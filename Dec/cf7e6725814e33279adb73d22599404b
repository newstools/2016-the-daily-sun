SOUTH Africa remain &ldquo;fully committed&rdquo; to hosting the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Durban despite falling short of requirements, officials say. They say they are still in talks with the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) over SA&rsquo;s bid.The comments came on Wednesday, the deadline to resolve a number of issues, such as failing to have a local organising committee set up within 180 days of winning the bid on 1 April 2014, and not depositing an initial payment of $1,79 million (more than R25m).Durban remains the only city with a confirmed bid after Edmonton in Canada withdrew in February. While South Africa said details from ongoing talks could not be revealed, the CGF insisted that 30 November was merely a deadline and not a day for announcements.&ldquo;The South African government is fully committed on hosting the Games,&rdquo; Esethu Hasane, spokesman for the Department of Sport and Recreation, was quoted as saying by China&rsquo;s Xinhua News Agency. &ldquo;Unfortunately, the department is not in a position to make any pronouncements on ongoing talks now.&rdquo; If Durban goes on to host the event, the Commonwealth Games will travel to Africa for the first time in its history.The 2018 Games will be held in Gold Coast, Australia. &ndash; REUTERS
