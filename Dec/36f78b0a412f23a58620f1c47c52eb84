Daily Sun ran an article about the prophet of the Spiritual Christian Church in Makgodu Village, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, who made his congregants drink Dettol antiseptic liquid.He said the Holy Spirit had instructed him to use the product. This, according to Phala, would help heal all congregants&rsquo; sicknesses. But the company has, warned the prophet to stop the practice because oral consumption of its product can endanger health.Euphemia Annor, the regional legal director of Dettol South Africa, said: &ldquo;Dettol has been proved to be safe and effective when used as per recommended directions; however it is not for human consumption and is for external use only. &ldquo;We are against Prophet Phala using the product inappropriately.&rdquo;Even after the company called the prophet on his phone and asked him to stop the practice, he was unfazed. When the Sun Team called him on Saturday, Phala told us he had already bought four bottles of the product for use during yesterday&rsquo;s service.He said: &ldquo;After last week&rsquo;s service I have been receiving amazing testimony from members of my church.&rdquo;
