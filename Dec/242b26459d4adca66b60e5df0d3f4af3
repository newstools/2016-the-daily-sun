Parliament&rsquo;s portfolio committee on communication inquiring into the SABC heard startling evidence today from SABC journalists suspended for questioning the corporation&rsquo;s editorial policy. SAFM executive producer of current affairs Krivani Pillay, and one of the editors at the broadcaster, Thandeka Gqubule, were testifying and the committee heard that former SABC Group CEO Jimi Matthews endorsed some of former CEO Hlaudi Motsoeneng's rogue decisions. &ldquo;What really surprised us was the response we got from Mr Jimi Matthews. He said it's cold outside, if you do not like it you can go,&rdquo; Pillay said.&nbsp;Pillay and Gqubule were part of a group of eight journalists who were suspended for questioning the SABC's editorial policy on protests.&nbsp; Former head of technology at the SABC Sipho Masinga also testified.&nbsp;He said he was called by then chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng to a surprise meeting with TNA Media&rsquo;s Nazeem Howa.&nbsp;TNA Media owns news broadcaster ANN7 and New Age newspaper.&nbsp;Masinga told MPs that TNA Media presented a plan to take over SABC News in just three pages. &ldquo;I look at it, it&rsquo;s talking about rebranding SABC News, that the SABC will provide resources, TNA will not pay any rental, SABC will provide journalists, TNA will retain advertising revenue,&rdquo; Masinga said. This would have meant outsourcing the public broadcaster&rsquo;s news offering to the Gupta company. Masinga rejected the proposal, saying: &ldquo;Just that itself was enough for me to send him back. But you know, we had to find a cunning way to say, &lsquo;just go and make it more appealing&rsquo; &hellip; so we sent it back.&rdquo; Masinga said Motsoeneng had earlier left the meeting, which took place before TNA Media launched its own news channel, ANN7, in 2013.
