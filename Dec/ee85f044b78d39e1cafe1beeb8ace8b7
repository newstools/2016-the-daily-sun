Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has called on captain Wayne Rooney to rediscover his goalscoring form in order to help out striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic.&nbsp;Ibrahimovic is the only player living up to expectations for Mourinho, and in order to reduce the pressure on the Swede, Mourinho is turning to Rooney, who is just one goal shy of equalling Sir Bobby Charlton's all-time record of 249 for the club. Furthermore, Rooney has not scored since the first game of the season against Bournemouth in August.&nbsp;The Red Devils have also failed to establish themselves as a major threat when it comes to scoring goals as they have found the back of the net just 19 times in 14 games.&nbsp;"As an attacking player, normally he [Rooney] scores more goals," Mourinho said. "He scored a couple, I think, at Fenerbahce and one in the Premier League."We expect more goals from him, yes, but we expect more goals from everyone in the team. Maybe Zlatan is the one, but as the main striker it is normal that he has more goals scored. But all the other attacking players, we expect more goals from them."Rooney&rsquo;s goal drought could have something to do with the uncertainty of his position as he has been used as a midfielder in the past by England managers Roy Hodgson, Sam Allardyce and Gareth Southgate.&nbsp;For Mourinho though, he will always see the 31-year-old as an attacking player.&nbsp;&ldquo;With me, he is an attacking player,&rdquo; Mourinho said. "In the national team, they can do with him what they want to do. In the national team he is their player, he is not my player, and they can do what they want."If they want to play him right-back, they can play him right-back. It's not my problem, but in my team, he is an attacking player -- he will play as a nine or a 10, or eventually coming from one of the sides."United currently sit in sixth place on the Premier League standings and will be in for a tough challenge on Sunday as they will take on Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford.&nbsp;
