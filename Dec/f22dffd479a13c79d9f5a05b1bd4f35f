ZIMBABWE&rsquo;S first lady, Grace Mugabe (51), has raised more eyebrows after she allegedly grabbed properties belonging to a Lebanese businessman before forcing him into exile. She ordered a R21 million ring from gem dealer Jamal Ahmed to commemorate her 20th wedding anniversary with husband Robert Mugabe, but the businessman took extra time to deliver the gem. She later rejected the jewel and demanded a refund. She wanted the money to be deposited into her Dubai account, but the dealer refused. A payment plan to deposit the money into her Zimbabwean account was reportedly not acceptable to her. Ahmed is challenging her actions in the high court. &ndash; CAJ NEWS
