JUST how many people must be killed on the roads before people do what is right?Drunk drivers and pedestrians are a major road danger during the festive season.Mpumelelo Tyikwe, managing director of Alexander Forbes Insurance, said being caught drunk this festive season will get you into trouble.According to Mzansi law, it is illegal for any person with a blood alcohol level of 0,05g or higher to be driving.&ldquo;Your insurance premiums will likely increase as you will be considered a high-risk driver. Your insurer may even refuse to renew your policy,&rdquo; he said.And you could face jail time and be liable for fines and homicide charges resulting in a criminal record and the suspension of your licence. &ldquo;Many insurers also exclude cover where it is reliably witnessed that you were under the influence.&ldquo;This means that you will be liable to pay for damages caused from your own pocket,&rdquo; said Tyikwe.Between 1 December 2015 and 11 January this year, 1 755 people died on our roads and many were alcohol-related.Alcohol reduces your ability to drive as it causes:Tunnel vision &ndash; Drunk drivers only see tunnel vision or what&rsquo;s directly in front of them and are less aware of their surroundings.Slower reactions &ndash; You are slower when you are drunk. By the time you see something wrong, it&rsquo;s too late.Lack of focus &ndash; Drunk drivers are distracted drivers.Poor judgment &ndash; Your ability to judge distances between still and moving objects is reduced.
