HOW are tomatoes turned into sauce? The right man to answer that question is engineer Naftalie Knight (58) from Riverlea, in Jozi. This mfundisi builds machines which make sauce, chemicals, juice, sweets and cool drinks. He told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Before I build anything, I plan a layout, draw sketches and tell the customer how it&rsquo;s going to work.&rdquo; Naftalie said in the case of a tomato sauce machine, he needs to know how much sauce it has to produce. &ldquo;So, I&rsquo;ll build the pot with a mixer. If there&rsquo;s no electricity on the site, I design a gas heater. But such a plant will also need a heat exchanger to cool down the sauce.&rdquo; He said a tomato sauce factory needs many other machines. Some wash bottles, others fill them, label them and stick on date codes. At the end of the production line, the bottles are packed in cardboard boxes, ready for delivery. Naftalie said he started as a floor sweeper in the 1970s and moved into the 1980s as a welder, boiler maker and mechanical engineer. He has travelled Africa, putting up sugar blending machinery. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen the door of a university. I learnt from the workshop.&rdquo; Naftalie says it takes him up to three months to complete a big factory, and only two or three weeks for a small set of machines. His company is Cool Run Worx, based in the Pennyville industrial area, New Canada, Gauteng. He employs six full-time workers, including welders, boiler makers and engineers. He&rsquo;s built production lines for the brands All Joy, Mega Candy, Red Farms, All Sauce, Nature&rsquo;s Garden, Unibisco and Kay-Chem.
