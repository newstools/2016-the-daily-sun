MAMELODI Sundowns are not worried about their opponents in their first match of the Fifa Club World Cup in Japan on Sunday.The Brazilians will know who they will be up against today after the first round match between Kashima Antlers (the J-League champions) and New Zealand&rsquo;s Auckland City (12:30pm SA time).Sundowns arrived in Osaka late on Tuesday and received an official welcome from Fifa delegates.The seven-times Absa Premiership champions had their first training session at the Kincho Stadium last night, getting their first chance to familiarise themselves with conditions before they kick off the tournament.Sundowns striker Khama Billiat, who is one of the nominees for African Player of the Year based in Africa, says they don&rsquo;t mind who they play, they are ready for whichever team wins today&rsquo;s clash.He stated: &ldquo;Playing a home team is always difficult but if the home team comes through, we will be ready. We have worked so hard to be here. It&rsquo;s up to us now to make sure we do the right thing. We can&rsquo;t give it away at this stage, we will go all out. &ldquo;We want to achieve things that have never been done before. &ldquo;Playing Real Madrid, who we normally only get to on TV, is a dream. Now we just need to make it a reality.&rdquo;The Spanish giants will only enter the competition at the semifinal stage next week.The 26-year-old Zimbabwean born striker emphasised the importance of converting each and every chance they get.&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always going to be pressure but I&rsquo;m happy with that, because it means that we are playing for something. &ldquo;In games like these you might need just one goal, which means if you get one chance you have to take it. In the league we have been scoring a lot, now we must make sure we convert every chance we create here in Japan.&rdquo; said Billiat.
