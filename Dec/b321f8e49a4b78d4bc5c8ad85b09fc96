FORMER Generations actress, Nambitha Mpumlwana, is allegedly facing financial problems.That&rsquo;s according to several friends close to the actress who said they&rsquo;re tired of helping her without being appreciated.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been acting as Nambitha&rsquo;s everything. From being a pillar of strength, to helping try sort out her problems. But she never appreciates my efforts,&rdquo; said one friend.Another source claimed Nambitha is struggling to secure long-term jobs as producers are afraid to book her.The source said in the past producers complained that she&rsquo;s a difficult person, whose many demands make her difficult to work with.She was allegedly released from her Generations contract because apparently, the creators were tired of her &ldquo;diva&rdquo; tendencies. She then went on to join e.tv&rsquo;s Ashes to Ashes in the main lead role.A second source claimed Nambitha relies on friends to drive her to interviews and auditions.&ldquo;She asks them to wait for her until she finishes, so they can drop her off at home,&rdquo; our showbiz mole alleged.The source said this happened recently when Nambitha was a guest on a shoot for a new TV show.&ldquo;If only Nambitha could diversify and go into production. But instead she waits for jobs and the salary of an actress.&ldquo;Her peers are writing scripts, developing new shows and even directing and producing. I wish she&rsquo;d consider this route,&rdquo; said the friend.Another source said lately Nambitha doesn&rsquo;t go a week without sharing her booking details on social media, especially advertising her MC abilities.Her body of work includes productions in the UK.When called for comment, Nambitha hung up the phone.
