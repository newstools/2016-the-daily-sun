THE Hawks arrested two of their members for corruption on Friday. The two officers are accused of having demanded a R100 000 bribe to make a case disappear. The suspects from the Hawks in Gauteng, Sergeant Sithembo Dlamini (54) and Captain Saul Mdletshe, allegedly planned to pocket R100 000 from a suspect arrested for fraud in Brackendowns, Ekurhuleni. The officers allegedly took almost R10 000 on two separate occasions from the same suspect to have him released on bail.The suspects&rsquo; lawyer, Stephens Mangolela (46), was also arrested after allegedly working with the two officers to put together the corrupt deal. Gauteng Hawks spokeswoman Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu said: an operation was carried out by the Hawks&rsquo; Tshwane-based serious corruption unit just outside Joburg on Friday. &ldquo;The three were presented with half of the R100 000 in cash, while the rest was transferred into the lawyer&rsquo;s account,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mangolela, Dlamini and Mdletshe were arrested on the spot and spent the weekend behind bars. &ldquo;They appeared in the Palm Ridge Magistrates Court on Monday on charges of corruption, extortion and defeating the ends of justice.&rdquo; The three have been granted bail of R2 000 each and they are expected to appear in court again on 9 June pending further investigations.
