THE Western Cape ANC plans to lodge a complaint with the SA Human Rights Commission and police today after a Hout Bay resident apparently called blacks &ldquo;stupid animals&rdquo; in a Facebook post.&ldquo;They are like stupid animals. We should tie them to a rope. Too many Africans flocking to Hout Bay. Draw up a petition. Soon there will be nothing left of Hout Bay,&rdquo; read the post Vanessa Hartley made on the Hout Bay Complete Facebook page.It was posted on Sunday and has since been removed.ANC Western Cape spokesperson Yonele Diko said: &ldquo;We believe the majority of people in South Africa do not share these views. Racists will never have the final word in this country.&rdquo;DA ward councillor for Hout Bay, Roberto Miguel Quintas, said he condemned Hartley&rsquo;s comments.&ldquo;I personally am working extremely hard on this for the people of Hout Bay and am grossly disappointed when I see threads of this nature,&rdquo; Quintas replied to Hartley&rsquo;s comment.&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t allow society to be divided by this type of racist agenda,&rdquo; DA Western Cape spokesperson Anneke Scheepers said.Hartley could not be reached for comment.&nbsp;&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/anc-to-lodge-hrc-complaint-for-stupid-animals-post-20161205
