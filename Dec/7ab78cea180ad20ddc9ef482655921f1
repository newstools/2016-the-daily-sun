IF THE prophet&rsquo;s words are true, the calf with two heads saved the gogo&rsquo;s family from a great tragedy.Gogo Mabhulukwana Nkosi (74) from Nhlakanipho Village in Edumbe, KZN couldn&rsquo;t believe her eyes when her cow gave birth to a calf with two heads on Saturday.But then a prophet told her one of her grandchildren was supposed to give birth to a child with a disability. However, the ancestors sent the disability to the animal.&ldquo;I am relieved to know my grandchildren escaped a curse.&ldquo;What surprises me most is that I did not invite the prophet,&rdquo; she said.The calf was born with two heads joined at the skull. It was breathing but couldn&rsquo;t stand. Edumbe mayor Majuba Mavuso said the calf was taken by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Sazi Mhlongo, president of the South African Traditional Healers Association, said such incidents happen for different reasons.&ldquo;The family needs to consult a sangoma to find out more,&rdquo; said Mhlongo.Stephan Vickers, vice-chairman of the Vryheid SPCA, confirmed that they took the calf. He said the condition is called polycephaly when an animal has two heads.&ldquo;It died on Monday as it was unable to eat. This was the first time I saw a calf with the condition.&rdquo;
