ZITHULELE Zuma wants justice. The 27-year-old from Malukazi in Durban said cops from Umbilo SAPS assaulted and set dogs on him two months ago after accusing him of robbing a man of his cellphone and bag in Isipingo.However, all charges against him were withdrawn in the Durban Magistrates Court on Tuesday due to a lack of evidence. &ldquo;I want to pursue a case against the cops who attacked me. I don&rsquo;t have a job because of them.&rdquo; Zithulele, who worked as a taxi conducter in Isipingo, said he was on his way to buy food when he ran into the cops. &ldquo;A police vehicle stopped next to me and one shot was fired into the air. Two cops grabbed and handcuffed me.&rdquo; Zithulele told the SunTeam he was taken to the Isipingo Police Station where the cops made him sign documents before transporting him to Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital. &ldquo;From there I was referred to King Edward Hospital where I was for two weeks. When I was discharged last month, I was arrested.&rdquo; Moses Dlamini, Ipid spokesman, encouraged Zithulele to report the matter to cops or Ipid. NPA spokeswoman Natasha Kara confirmed a charge of robbery against Zithulele was withdrawn. &ldquo;According to an affidavit from the investigating officer, the complainant showed no interest in the matter and failed to keep several appointments.&rdquo;
