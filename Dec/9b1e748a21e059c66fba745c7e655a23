JOHN Mdluli saved his family on Saturday night after receiving a warning from his ancestors. The 42-year-old told his family to go into the house and lock the doors. Shortly afterwards, four armed men burst into his tavern, shooting dead two patrons and wounding five more! John&rsquo;s wife, Fatima, said the tavern looked like a war zone after the incident. The 39-year-old from Ivory Park extension two, Ekurhuleni, told the SunTeam at first she didn&rsquo;t understand why her husband pulled her and other family members into the house and told them to go to sleep.&ldquo;John said his ancestors had warned him we were in danger. I tried to resist but he dragged me and the children into the house. &ldquo;Shortly after we went inside at 8pm, the men arrived in a Toyota Corolla and caused havoc. They shot one patron 12 times, killing him instantly. Another man died in hospital,&rdquo; she said. Fatima said more than 40 bullets were found on the floor of the tavern the next day and there was blood all over. She said one of the bullets hit the spot where she had been sitting. Thomas Mathebula (30), who was at the tavern at the time of the incident, said: &ldquo;Some of the people who were shot were just passing by and got caught in the crossfire.&rdquo;Witness Edward Langa said he was terrified when he saw a man holding two firearms and shooting at random. Ivory Park police spokesman Captain Bernard Matimulane said the cops were hunting for four men in connection with the tavern shooting. He said two cases of murder and five counts of attempted murder were opened.
