Rocky Malebane-Metsing, the former North West MEC for agriculture, was laid to rest on Saturday. The 67-year-old who served at different levels in the ANC and government, was buried in Kanana in Rustenburg.Speakers at his funeral hailed him as a God-fearing priest who was softly spoken, intelligent and steadfast about what he wanted. His love for the country was admired as he devoted his life to politics, despite having his own businesses. Malebana-Metsing is the founder of the SACP branch in his Kanana village. He was a priest at the El Shaddai Church and founder of the People&rsquo;s Progressive Party in the former Bophuthatswana. His party staged a coup to topple former Bophuthatswana president Lucas Mangope in 1988. A family member said that on the day of his death he had gone to hospital for a simple eye check-up. He fell ill while at the hospital while his son had gone to fetch his file. He came back to find him dead. Speakers at the funeral raised questions about the absence of representatives from local government as Rocky served as a councillor for Forum 4 service delivery. There was also no one from provincial government where he once served as an MEC, or from national government.Former MEC Mandlenkosi Mayisela said the ANC must find it in their hearts to forgive Rocky and not hate him even when he is dead. &ldquo;They must honour Rocky in a manner befitting his role in the struggle. Stop being mean and petty. The unity you preach must be demonstrated by leadership.&rdquo;
