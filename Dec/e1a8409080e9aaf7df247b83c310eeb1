ACCORDING to the auditor-general&rsquo;s report, the SABC did not take effective steps to prevent wasteful spending.As a result, the full extent of the damage could not be measured.The report was part of a document the public broadcaster refused to hand over to the parliamentary committee inquiry into its affairs.The public broadcaster&rsquo;s executives walked out of the inquiry on Wednesday, saying the report should have been available in braille, as board chairman Professor Mbulaheni Maguvhe is blind.The SABC board refused to hand over 10 of the 15 documents demanded by the committee.City Press reported the executives claimed some documents were missing, including a management report responding to the auditor-general&rsquo;s findings.A document detailing internal audit meetings was also not handed over, as well as other documents about the appointment of Hlaudi Motsoeneng as group executive for corporate affairs.The auditor-general&rsquo;s report, dated 31 March, also found people were hired in positions that had not been advertised, and those who were employed often didn&rsquo;t have the required qualifications or experience.Alice Muller, corporate executive at the auditor-general&rsquo;s office, last week told Parliament about documents detailing R141 million in expenditure that the auditor-general did not receive from the SABC.The report also revealed the SABC did not reveal the full extent of their wasteful spending.It was also found that disciplinary steps were not taken against officials who wasted money.
