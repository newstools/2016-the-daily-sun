THE Maluleke family are worried that thugs may have drugged them with fish oil before robbing them.Elizabeth Maluleke (48) said thugs came to her house in Kgabalatsane, North West last Tuesday night.&ldquo;Thugs came into our house and helped themselves to special things in the house while we were sleeping.&ldquo;Our toiletries were gone and so was our underwear, two computer tablets, a laptop and R1 000, but they left our appliances.&rdquo; Elizabeth claims the thugs drugged them with oil.&ldquo;We saw fish oil on the bedroom window,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;On Tuesday night we were all fast asleep. Usually we wake up during the night to go to the toilet or drink water but this night was different. Everybody was fast asleep, as if we were drugged.&rdquo;She said the thugs didn&rsquo;t break anything to enter. &ldquo;We think they used fish oil to get into the house.&rdquo;She said she fears the thugs will come back to get the other appliances.&ldquo;We are scared because we don&rsquo;t know who these people are. We don&rsquo;t know if they really drugged us or if they had keys to our house,&rdquo; she said. North West Police spokeswoman, Colonel Emelda Setlhako, said a case of housebreaking and theft was being investigated.
