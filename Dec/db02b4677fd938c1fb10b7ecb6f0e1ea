IN SOME villages and kasis, residents hang festive lights that they switch on at night. But in Mangabazini Village in Ntshongweni, KZN, a terrifying thing happens when the sun goes down.Every night since last month, hundreds of millipedes have invaded the homes of about 10 families, crawling up walls and dropping from ceilings!Residents claim the stubborn millipedes have even caused strange illnesses.Sindi Mbhele (37) said it wasn&rsquo;t clear where the millipedes come from.&ldquo;Maybe there&rsquo;s an evil sangoma who wants to hurt us,&rdquo; said Sindi.&ldquo;The millipedes crawl on the walls, gather on curtains or just fall from the ceiling. We always kill them on the spot but before you know it, another bunch crawl up the walls.&rdquo;Sindi said residents suspect evil people were involved because when they kill the millipedes, some people get sick.&ldquo;I use my right hand when I kill these evil creatures, but after that it gets painful. &ldquo;My kids even developed rashes after they killed the millipedes,&rdquo; Sindi told Daily Sun.She said she used muthi to try to drive the millipedes away, but nothing seems to help.Another resident, Norah Zuma (61), said her mum moved out of her house because she was so afraid of them. Councillor Jabulani Phewa said he reported the matter to the SPCA.Inspector Petros Simamane of Kloof SPCA said they couldn&rsquo;t help, and have referred the matter to Ezemvelo Wildlife.Musa Mntambo, spokesman for Ezemvelo, said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d talk to an expert about the matter as he might be able to explain the situation better.&rdquo;Thandonjani Hlongwane, chairman of the KZN Traditional Healers Association, said: &ldquo;These millipedes have been sent by someone. There&rsquo;s an inyanga who is testing his or her muthi in the village. &ldquo;Residents should get a strong muthi to burn the millipedes and destroy them.&rdquo;
