IT&rsquo;S the festive season and malls are busy with smiling kids and their parents shopping around for the holidays.But in KwaMashu, north of Durban, tears mark the faces of several social grant beneficiaries.They got the shock of their lives when they went to withdraw their grants at ATMs, only to find there was no money in the accounts.Since last month, the gogos, madalas and mums have allegedly been visiting the Sassa offices in Bridge City to get an explanation about their grants, but with no luck. Basiziwe Mavundla (52) from L section claimed she only found R20 in her account instead of R1 780 for her two adopted kids when she went to withdraw her grant. &ldquo;I almost fainted when I got R20 on 28 November. &ldquo;I immediately went to the Sassa offices in Bridge City, but they told to me to come back the next day. I even went to Sassa offices in the Durban CBD, but they also couldn&rsquo;t help me,&rdquo; said Basiziwe. &ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t know what happened to my money.&rdquo;Another grant beneficiary, Mafiki Mkhize (43), said she went to withdraw money at the ATM on Monday, but only got R180 instead of R660 for her two kids.&ldquo;At first I thought it was a mistake. I tried again but still there was no money,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;This is not fair because I wanted to buy clothes for my kids.&ldquo;When I went to the Sassa offices, nobody could explain what had happened,&rdquo; she said. Vusi Mahaye, spokesman for the social development department, said the complainants should visit their nearest Sassa offices with affidavits, explaining that they didn&rsquo;t know anything about the deductions. &ldquo;If they are not responsible for the money which was deducted, they will be refunded.&rdquo;
