AN Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) was apparently spotted about 300m above a plane last night before it was seen hurtling towards earth, the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) said today.The UFO was spotted around 9.30pm yesterday."A Boeing 737 cargo aircraft captain and co-pilot, flying from Cape Town International Airport to Port Elizabeth International Airport, reported seeing what appeared to be a green object increasing in altitude past the cockpit of their aeroplane, reaching to about a thousand feet (300m) into the clouds above them, and then returning towards earth at high speed past the cockpit of the aeroplane," NSRI spokesman Craig Lambinon said."The sighting was reported to air traffic control at Port Elizabeth International Airport who requested NSRI's assistance to investigate the possibility that an aircraft or craft may be in difficulty."Lambinon said the NSRI's Jeffreys Bay team monitored the matter throughout the night."The green object has not been seen since and there are no reports of anyone, or craft or aircraft overdue or missing."Lambinon said the incident happened about 10 nautical miles (18kms) off the Jeffreys Bay shore.At first it was thought the object was a green parachute flare, but this was ruled out because the flares "cannot reach that height"."No further reports of sightings have been received and the incident remains a mystery," Lambinon said.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ufo-spotted-1-000-feet-in-sky-before-hurtling-towards-earth-nsri-20161213
