SAMUEL Maboke complained to authorities that the tracking device fitted to him was not on the list of his parole conditions.He got no help and approached Daily Sun, looking for help, and his story was published. But now he&rsquo;s back behind bars, and he claims it is his punishment for going to the media.The 53-year-old man from Ikageng, near Potchefstroom, North West said: &ldquo;Officials say I violated my parole conditions. I&rsquo;m told I&rsquo;ll be behind bars for 12 months. &ldquo;But in the conditions they gave me there was no mention that an electronic tracking device had to be fixed to my leg. I still insist these people are abusing their power and making this thing personal.&rdquo;He was released on parole in September, and officials put a tracking device on his leg. At the time, correctional services spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo said devices were allocated to offenders at the instruction of the Parole Board or a court of law, in cases when someone was granted bail when their case had not been finalised. He said Samuel was classified a habitual offender and that the Parole Board felt he had to be monitored for at least 12 months through the device. Daily Sun asked Nxumalo about Samuel&rsquo;s re-arrest and whether it was as punishment for the story that appeared in the People&rsquo;s Paper.Nxumalo said: &ldquo;We will never lock up any parolee on the basis of a media interview, unless conditions for his parole placement have been violated. I&rsquo;m waiting for a report so that a proper response can be provided.&rdquo;
