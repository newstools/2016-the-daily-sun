JACOB Joba passed the school year with good marks but tragically died on his way to fetch his report. The 13-year-old was travelling on a train from Mindalore, Mogale City, to fetch his report at Roodepoort Primary School when he fell out of a carriage and died on the scene! Following the tragic incident on Wednesday morning, Jacob&rsquo;s family was called to the scene to identify his body. A family member later went to the school to share the sad news and collect his report. Jacob had passed his grade well but he never got to find this out or celebrate his achievement. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Tshepiso Mashele said: &ldquo;At about 8am, the boy was travelling on a train to school when he fell out and died. The train was apparently full at the time of the incident.&rdquo; Mashele said a case was opened at Krugersdorp Police Station and the incident was being investigated. Jacob&rsquo;s grandad said no one could have expected such a terrible tragedy.&ldquo;We were all hoping to see him running to us and screaming with his report in his hand that day. He was a good-hearted boy who would not have hurt a fly. We are still shocked by what has happened.&rdquo; On Saturday, a fundraising event was held at Salvage B&amp;G in Mindalore to raise money for Jacob&rsquo;s funeral and to help his parents during their time of need.
