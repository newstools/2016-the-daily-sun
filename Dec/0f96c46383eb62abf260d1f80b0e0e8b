Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and a delegation of ministers received a hostile welcome from some Daveyton residents during a World Aids Day event today.&nbsp;As Ramaphosa took to the podium&nbsp;to address the crowd at the Mabina Stadium, a large group started booing and chanting "voetsek".&nbsp; Community volunteers who work with HIV-infected youth said they had not been paid for seven months.&nbsp; They held placards which read "7 months without pay", "Voetsek to the minimum wage" and "We want our money now". Ekurhuleni Mayor Mzwandile Masina pleaded with the crowd to calm down. "I will come and listen to your concerns, but we must let the programme continue," Masina said, as the crowd continued relentlessly.&nbsp;Masina, along with a squad of bodyguards, then marched to the stands with the volunteers. He was soon chased away by the crowd.&nbsp;The mood of the crowd shifted soon after Ramaphosa started his address, when he said he and government were working towards addressing the concerns of community workers.&nbsp;The crowd's boos then turned to resounding cheers as Ramaphosa explained that government was in the process of attending to the minimum wage bill proposal.&nbsp;At least 2 000 people attended the event. Also in attendance was Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi and Gauteng Premier David Makhura.&nbsp; http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/watch-ramaphosa-booed-at-world-aids-day-event-2016120 Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and a delegation of ministers received a hostile welcome from some Daveyton residents during a World Aids Day event today.&nbsp;As Ramaphosa took to the podium&nbsp;to address the crowd at the Mabina Stadium, a large group started booing and chanting "voetsek".&nbsp; Community volunteers who work with HIV-infected youth said they had not been paid for seven months.&nbsp; They held placards which read "7 months without pay", "Voetsek to the minimum wage" and "We want our money now".
