THE African Diaspora Forum (ADF) marched against Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba today following his comments about illegal immigrants.Earlier this month Mashaba told the media that illegal immigrants should leave the city as they were there illegally and should be treated as such, according to Times Live.These remarks were made at a press conference following his address in the council on his first 100 days as mayor.His comments prompted the home affairs department to caution him.ADF secretary Obvious Katsaura also said these comments were dangerous, hostile and can incite violence, given the previous xenophobic incidents in Johannesburg and other parts of the country."Migrants were part of the people who built the city that you are leading today. It is essential for you as the mayor of the city, to refresh your memory with the history of the city of Johannesburg. Not all migrants are criminals. Crime doesn't have a nationality."Calling for unity, Katsaura said migrants could contribute positively to the economic growth of the city.They would also hand over a memorandum to the mayor. &nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/adf-march-against-mashaba-for-illegal-immigrants-comments-20161219
