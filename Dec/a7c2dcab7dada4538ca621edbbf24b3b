THE clash of religions got ugly on Sunday afternoon when men of God threw a sangoma&rsquo;s belongings out of her house.The men claimed sangoma Nomozwakhe Eland (16) and her mum Mapule Motsepe (43) were living in the house in Kgabalatsane Village, North West illegally. However, Mapule told Daily Sun she had been in the home for over 10 years and didn&rsquo;t deserve to be evicted. Residents watched in horror as bones, muthi and traditional drums were thrown out of the house by more than 20 men. One of the men, Elias Kau (67), said the house had belonged to his late uncle, Samuel. He said after Samuel&rsquo;s death in 2006, Mapule came to live in the house for free. He said he asked her in March to move out because he wanted to erect a tombstone for his uncle. &ldquo;I gave her until the end of September to leave. I explained my uncle had been a priest in the Apostolic Church. We didn&rsquo;t want Mapule and Nomozwakhe in the house while we were unveiling the tombstone,&rdquo; he said. Mapule said Elias is a liar. &ldquo;He never had a problem with my daughter being a sangoma. He even attended her graduation ceremony in February.&rdquo; Nomozwakhe said she was shocked by what had happened. &ldquo;We have been good friends to the family and they knew I was treating people in the yard. &ldquo;The problem is that they want to put a homeless relative in the house. We have been living here since I was still in creche but now we are sleeping in a car because we have nowhere to go.&rdquo; Elias said he was not going to change his mind &ndash; the mum and her daughter needed to leave.
