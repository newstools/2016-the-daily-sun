THE two girls were chatting while washing clothes in Makuleke Dam and didn&rsquo;t realise that they were being watched. Mimi Chauke (16) and her friend Caroline Noela (17) faced death on Friday morning in Makuleke Village, outside Malamulele, Limpopo.Mimi said:&ldquo;Something in my spirit told me to look in the direction of the water. To my surprise, I saw two hippos moving towards us.We both screamed in terror. We left our clothes and ran away.&rdquo;Mimi said when she looked back, she saw that the two hippos had left the water and were chasing them.&ldquo;We ran as if we were possessed with demons so the hippos couldn&rsquo;t catch us. And when the hippos realised that they couldn&rsquo;t catch us, they gave up the chase and went back to the water.&rdquo; Caroline said: &ldquo;For a moment I thought the hippos were going to kill us. It was the first time I&rsquo;ve seen hippos outside the water. I didn&rsquo;t know that a hippo was as big as a cow.&rdquo; Eric Tivani from the local tribal authority told Daily Sun: &ldquo;There are a lot of hippos in that dam. And I can tell you that they are very dangerous. A year ago, a local fisherman was attacked and wounded by a hippo. &ldquo;He later died in Malamulele Hospital.&rdquo;
