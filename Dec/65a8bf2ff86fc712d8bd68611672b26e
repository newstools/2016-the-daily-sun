IT WAS supposed to be a normal day for the Shumaya vocalist.&nbsp; But parking in the wrong place at the wrong time turned into a nightmare.&nbsp; HER HOURS IN JOBURG CENTRAL SEEMED LIKE A LIFETIME IN HELL.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been arrested and beaten by cops,&rdquo; said Zinhle Ngidi (23), the house vocalist on the popular hit song Shumaya by Dbn Nyts. &ldquo;They accused me of parking in the wrong place. They told me to move. But it didn&rsquo;t end there. They attacked me.&rdquo; The drama started when she went to fetch her child from her mother&rsquo;s flat in the Joburg CBD and parked on the corner of Plein and Wanderers Streets. Zinhle&rsquo;s mother, Nonhlanhla Ngidi (47) told Daily Sun the chaos that erupted on the street could have easily been sorted out. &ldquo;When Zinhle got upstairs to my flat she complained about having an argument with a Metro cop downstairs over a parking space,&rdquo; said Nonhlanhla. She said she went down to the car with Zinhle and the baby. Zinhle&rsquo;s sister Nokuthula Ngidi (27) was also with them.&nbsp; &ldquo;The cops started making a noise and told her she wasn&rsquo;t supposed to park there. They had an argument which turned into flying hot klaps being handed out to my daughter by the cops.&rdquo; Zinhle&rsquo;s mother claimed they told the cops people were taking videos that could work against them. &ldquo;But the cops said videos can be made to vanish,&rdquo; she claimed. Zinhle, her five-month-old baby and Nokuthula were all taken to Joburg Central Police Station. At about 2.30pm, Zinhle&rsquo;s manager, Bhuti Sithole, told Daily Sun Zinhle was going to be released in about two hours. This was after her lawyer went to the police station. Bhuti said a case of assault was opened against Zinhle. &ldquo;When we got to the police station and also tried to open a case of assault, we were told we couldn&rsquo;t because police had arrested her and opened a case before she did.&rdquo; Gauteng provincial police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubela said according to information received, the suspect is alleged to have assaulted the officers. &ldquo;She was brought into the station with a child but the child was handed over to Bhuti and her mother. She is facing a charge of assaulting officers,&rdquo; said Makhubela. At the time of going to press it was not yet clear if Zinhle had been released because Bhuti&rsquo;s phone was switched off. Joburg Metro police spokesman, Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar, said it was unfortunate the motorist had to be arrested. &ldquo;Our officers were doing their work. It&rsquo;s a pity they were assaulted. We now have to let the law take its course.&rdquo;&nbsp;
