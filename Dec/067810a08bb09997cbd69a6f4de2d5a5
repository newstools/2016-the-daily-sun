THIS week it emerged that the ANC-led Emfuleni Municipality is owed more than R600 000 by the regional offices of the ANC in the Vaal! In response to a question Kingsol Chabalala, a provincial legislature member for the DA, said co-operative governance MEC Paul Mashatile revealed that the party owed the municipality R614 199. &ldquo;This comes after the ANC-run municipality contracted a debt collection agency for R157 million earlier this year to track down residents who had not paid their municipal bills,&rdquo; said Chabalala. &ldquo;The ANC clearly has double standards and cannot pay its own bills to its own municipality.&rdquo; He said the ANC needed to pay for the services it received. &ldquo;The ANC is not a poor organisation. It has a responsibility to pay for the services it makes use of. The DA will follow up on this matter and ensure the ANC pays its outstanding rates and taxes,&rdquo; he said. ANC Sedibeng spokesman, Themba Ndaba, said the party had been flooded with media enquiries regarding its municipal account. &ldquo;We acknowledge the debt. Like any other resident, company or institution which has its operations and offices based in Emfuleni Municipality, we will make the necessary arrangements to settle our account.&rdquo; When asked about the debt collection company, which has annoyed many residents, he said: &ldquo;We have requested the municipality to look into the matter. &ldquo;The call was made following complaints of harassment by residents. We have demanded the leadership of the administration to place this matter under review without compromising the payment of services by residents.&rdquo;
