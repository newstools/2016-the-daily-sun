MZANSI singer Winnie Khumalo is a cheat, according Zimbabwean-born artist, Lyonel Siwela.He claimed Winnie had breached the terms of their contract.&ldquo;Winnie is greedy! She&rsquo;s taking advantage because I&rsquo;m a foreigner,&rdquo; Lyonel said. &ldquo;The song was meant to be a collaboration!&rdquo;And the ditty in question is Winnie&rsquo;s hit song, Lazaru, which has gone some way to lifting her fading music career.Then Lyonel alleged the song &ndash; gaining traction on radio stations and had landed Winnie some gigs &ndash; was not hers.The singer, presently in Zimbabwe, told Sunday Sun the tune was his despite only being credited as a featured artist.&ldquo;I have all the original versions of that song and first released it in Zimbabwe last year,&rdquo; Lyonel said. &ldquo;I met Winnie early this year through producer, Bongo Beats, from Soshanguve in Pretoria. She liked the song and we agreed to collaborate on it.&rdquo;Lyonel then claimed that Winnie started ignoring his calls and blocking him across social media after the song was remade.&ldquo;Clearly, she had other plans for my song. She didn&rsquo;t even write it, but she goes around taking credit for the work and doesn&rsquo;t even own it,&rdquo; Lyonel said. &ldquo;She blocked me on WhatsApp and does not take my calls. I regret meeting her. Winnie really betrayed me.&rdquo; A showbiz informant claimed Lyonel would not let sleeping dogs lie.&ldquo;Now Lyonel is thinking about taking legal action against the Live My Life hitmaker &ndash; for using his song and sidelining him,&rdquo; the source said.&ldquo;The song was released in Zimbabwe last year. Lyonel was the lead singer.&ldquo;The collaboration was meant to be credited to Winnie and Lyonel &ndash; and not Winnie featuring Lyonel.&ldquo;She agreed to Lyonel&rsquo;s terms. But when the song was released, it was clear Winnie had robbed Lyonel. She went back on her word.&rdquo; But Winnie sang a different tune when asked for comment.&ldquo;The song was given to me by Bongo Beats. I met Lyonel through Bongo Beats and they gave me the song,&rdquo; Winnie said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t own anything in that song. They own the publishing rights.&rdquo;The singer said she was working hard to get the song some attention. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pushing the song in every way possible. I&rsquo;m the one going around the country promoting it. &ldquo;I have on several occasions asked him to join me ahead of time when going to perform, but he always comes up with excuses every time I call him.&rdquo;
