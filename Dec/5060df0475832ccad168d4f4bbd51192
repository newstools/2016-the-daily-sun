THE residents of Mtubatuba, KZN feel that the donation of two water trucks will not benefit them at all.The two tankers were donated by the department of co-operative governance and traditional affairs to Umkhanyakude Municipality on Monday.The trucks are supposed to supply water to parts of Mtubatuba.Elias Sikhosana (60), from Somkhele in Mtubatuba, told Daily Sun the trucks will not benefit them at all.&ldquo;The two additional trucks won&rsquo;t solve our problems, because we are still forced to fetch water from dirty streams. &ldquo;We can see that the municipality is trying to resolve the water issue, but Mtubatuba is a very big area. &ldquo;The area needs about 15 trucks to address the water issue. Sometimes we have to share water with animals.&rdquo; Another resident, Nomvula Mkhwanazi (34), from KwaMsane, said the two trucks are not enough, and they need more vehicles.Mdu Dlamini, spokesman for the municipality, said there is a serious water crisis in most areas.&ldquo;The drought has negatively affected the supply of water, but the new trucks will supply water to Mtubatuba daily. &ldquo;I believe this intervention will assist at the moment, as we are still depending on donations,&rdquo; said Dlamini.
