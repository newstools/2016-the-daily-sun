THE THUGS thought they could outsmart a massive police roadblock at Beit Bridge border post.&nbsp; So they came up with a bizarre plan to smuggle a stolen vehicle from Limpopo to Zimbabwe.&nbsp; HOWEVER, THEY WERE CAUGHT OUT AFTER A POLICE HELICOPTER SPOTTED THE BAKKIE BEING PULLED ACROSS THE LIMPOPO RIVER BY DONKEYS LAST WEDNESDAY! The clever smugglers were discovered after Limpopo police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba decided to patrol the area in a helicopter.&nbsp; As Ledwaba and other cops were patrolling the area around Musina, they were shocked to see the bakkie floating in the middle of the river and immediately sent police to the scene.&nbsp; Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, Limpopo police spokesman, said: &ldquo;After Lieutenant-General Ledwaba visited a roadblock and went on a walkabout at a nearby mall, he decided to take a helicopter to patrol the area.&nbsp; &ldquo;While flying over the river, he noticed a suspected stolen grey Toyota Hilux double-cab bakkie in the river and he called for back-up. &ldquo;The vehicle was half under the water and the suspects were making use of five donkeys to pull it to the Zimbabwean side of the river.&rdquo; After the suspects realised the police were on to them, they fled into Zimbabwe, leaving the vehicle floating in the river.&nbsp; Brigadier Mojapelo told Daily Sun the bakkie was successfully removed from the water but the suspects got away.&nbsp; &ldquo;It took the police four hours to remove the bakkie from the river.&nbsp; &ldquo;Investigations conducted by the vehicle clearance unit indicated the bakkie was reported stolen earlier this month in Durban.&nbsp; &ldquo;The suspects managed to cross into Zimbabwe, abandoning the five donkeys and the vehicle in the middle of the river.&rdquo;
