SHIRLEY Gerepong is a heartbroken woman!Her helper of 11 years allegedly helped herself to all her belongings!The 55-year-old from Daveyton in Ekurhuleni said she got the shock of her life when she came back home from a funeral in Soweto on Saturday to find an empty house.She said the only person who was at the house at that time was her helper. Shirley said what breaks her heart even more was that the helper also took her wedding dress.&ldquo;That attire was very special, it has sentimental value to me.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe this woman. &ldquo;How could she do something like this to me. I treated her like family and took good care of her and her children.&ldquo;This is how she repays me?&rdquo;Shirley said she was introduced to her helper by a friend in 2005. &ldquo;Last week Saturday I went to Soweto to attend a friend&rsquo;s funeral, and when I returned, I discovered that all my belongings, from clothes to jewellery, including my wedding ring, were gone.
