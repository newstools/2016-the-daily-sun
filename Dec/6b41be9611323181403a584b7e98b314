RETIRED police officers in Malamulele, Limpopo, were celebrated at a party on Tuesday to honour their service and their old age.The United Pensioners Club for retired cops honoured their members &ndash; who range in age from 60 to 115 &ndash; at the event held in the Malamulele Club House.In his keynote address, deputy cluster commander in the Giyani Police Station, Brigadier Mbhazima Marhungani, appealed to the veterans to visit local stations to discourage young officers from taking early retirement. &ldquo;Today, we are facing a huge challenge in our workplace whereby many young officers take early retirement.&ldquo;And when we try to discourage them from doing so, they won&rsquo;t listen. &ldquo;The officers then misuse their pension funds and later want to be rehired back to their positions. And when they don&rsquo;t get re-employed, they resort to committing crime. Maybe they will listen to you,&rdquo; he told the pensioners.The celebration was attended by officials from Thulamela Municipality, traffic officers, local doctors and pastors. Club co-ordinator Misaveni Hlungwani (70) said: &ldquo;The aim of this celebration is to maintain and promote the status, well-being, safety and security of the retired police officers within the areas of our jurisdictions. &ldquo;We also maintain and promote the rights of the members, spouses, widows and widowers after the death of their beloved ones.&rdquo;
