WE are observing 16 Days of Activism Against Women and Children Abuse in Mzansi.What puzzles me is: how can a man who is presently involved in woman abuse be giving speeches all over the show about activism against women and children abuse?Women are human, like all of us.There s no way a woman can feel good about sharing her husband.Sharing a husband or a wife is a traumatic experience.So where does a second wife come into the life of a man who claims to be against all kinds of women abuse?Can the same man swallow his own medicine?Definitely not.If we want to overcome gender inequality in our society, so-called traditions should never be left unchallenged.Leaders should lead by example and be the first to walk the talk.Such men should stop using culture as a scapegoat.They need to man up and be disciplined. If you choose a woman to be your wife, love her wholeheartedly, and love her alone.That s what the Bible teaches about marriage.All this language of tradition, and culture this and culture that, is absolute nonsense!A big thumbs-up to all men out there who lead by example. Keep up the good work, all you monogamous guys you carry our nation s hope! ) NV Mahlangu, Mthambothini
