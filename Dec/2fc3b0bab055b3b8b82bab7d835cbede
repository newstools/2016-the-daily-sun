A SPAZA shop owner trusted a desperate woman.And he claimed she betrayed that trust, leaving Demeke Anuto (27) with no money or stock. Now Demeke is offering a R3 000 reward to anyone who can tell him where she is. Demeke told Daily Sun: &ldquo;A woman known as Moleshoane Mofokeng came to me earlier this month, looking desperate, and asked for a job.&ldquo;She told me that she was from Lesotho and showed me her passport.&ldquo;I gave her the job because I know how it feels to struggle in a foreign country.&rdquo;He said he hired the woman and trusted her enough to leave her with his shop in Slovo, phase four near Winterveld, north of Tshwane.&ldquo;I live in Mabopane and my shop is in Slovo. &ldquo;I trusted her to look after my shop,&rdquo; he added.But Monday brought tears to his eyes.&ldquo;Someone took everything, amounting to about R35 000, and left me with only a few sweets and potato chips,&rdquo; he claimed.Demeke said he wants the thief to be arrested and locked up in jail for a long time.Resident Manoko Moima said: &ldquo;I am very disappointed. The spaza shop was very helpful to us. &ldquo;Now we have to walk some distance to buy a loaf of bread.&rdquo; Captain Samuel Sebola said they are investigating a case of theft. &ldquo;Anyone with information on the suspect&rsquo;s whereabouts is asked to call the police on 012 797 7800.&rdquo;
