AFTER months of speculation, singer and producer Demor has finally tied the knot! Just over a week ago, the hitmaker married his long-time girlfriend Silungile Khumalo. The wedding service was at St Ives in Howick, near Pietermaritzburg in KZN.The following day they held Umabo at Demor&rsquo;s home at Bruntville township in Mooi River. It seems as if all is going well for Demor, with the recent release of his hit single titled Cliche. The private white wedding was kept a secret &ndash; as the couple and their families wanted the ceremony to be attended only by close friends and relatives.Early this year, our sister newspaper Daily Sun was the first publication to report that Demor, real name Thandulwazi Sikhosana, was officially off the market.That was after a traditional wedding that took place in Mooi River.The couple has a child together, and Demor has another child from a previous relationship.The white wedding was confirmed by Demor&rsquo;s best friend Xolani Mkhize.He said: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t reveal much because I was just an invited guest. The best person to speak to about the wedding is Demor.&ldquo;His wife is in Ghana, so it won&rsquo;t make sense to try and call her. And please be patient with Demor because he might be in meetings.&rdquo;According to sources close to the couple, the wedding was kept a secret because they had agreed on a small family gathering for the second event.And that&rsquo;s how it worked out, with the bride in a white wedding gown, admired only by guests who are close to the united families.Speaking on behalf of the couple, Demor said: &ldquo;It was more like a family thing. It&rsquo;s nice that I finally tied the knot with someone I love.&ldquo;It was truly amazing. I&rsquo;m happy to say she&rsquo;s no longer Slungile Khumalo. And now you can refer to her as Slungile Sikhosana,&rdquo; he said.Demor told the People&rsquo;s Paper Slungile couldn&rsquo;t comment because she was overseas on a business trip.
