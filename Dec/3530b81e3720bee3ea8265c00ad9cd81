VHEMBE Traditional Health Practitioners Forum chairman, Dumakude Maluleke, has warned fake traditional healers.He has urged them not to cheat unsuspecting clients, or face shame and prosecution.Maluleke also pledged his full support in working with the health department to stop HIV/Aids.He was speaking during the forum&rsquo;s launch at the Thohoyandou Indoor Sports Centre last Friday.The forum includes members of various traditional health organisations in Vhembe.Maluleke, one of the country&rsquo;s most respected traditional healers, said they used not to be on good terms with medical doctors, but things have changed for the better over the years.&ldquo;We have our own way of treating our patients but there are diseases we cannot treat.&ldquo;We do referrals to the hospital and now go all out to teach our members to protect ourselves and our patients. They use gloves and do not use the same needles or blades on different patients.&ldquo;We are also planning a meeting with traditional leaders so we can get to know each other. &ldquo;Our mandate is to cure people and we should do it with the blessings of traditional leaders and other community structures.&rdquo;He added that the time of working in isolation is over and they have to work towards healing the nation. Maluleke also said they are worried about chancers who spoil the image of traditional healers by practising without a calling to do so. &ldquo;We are making a call to all traditional healers to register with the relevant bodies.&ldquo;Otherwise, we will expose all fake healers and shame them or even have them arrested, because most of them are involved in wrong things like ritual murders.&rdquo;
