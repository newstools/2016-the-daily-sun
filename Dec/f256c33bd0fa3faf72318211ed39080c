RESIDENTS from KwaMakhutha Township on the south coast of Durban have to fetch water from a filthy spring in the nearby bush. Their water taps have run dry! According to Jeanette Ngcobo (54) it has been two weeks since they last had water. And the sad thing, said Jeanette, was that they were given no notice by eThekwini Municipality regarding water cuts. &ldquo;It is the festive season and with everyone at home the demand for water is extremely high. We need water in our homes. &ldquo;This lengthy stoppage is seriously giving us a hard time. As a result, we have to risk our lives and go to the nearby bush to look for muddy fountains so we can fetch water for bathing and flushing toilets.&rdquo;Jeanette&rsquo;s neighbour Lindiwe Mngomezulu (33) said they are still unhappy, even though municipal water tankers occasionally come to the kasi to bring them a few litres of water. &ldquo;Those few litres are not enough as we cannot use them to flush toilets or do laundry. We have to save them for cooking and drinking. I already have two full laundry baskets.&rdquo; The residents are appealing to the municipality to quickly resolve the matter before Christmas.Mandla Nsele, the municipality&rsquo;s acting spokesman, said the matter has been reported to the relevant unit for investigation.&ldquo;In the meantime, the municipality will continue sending water tankers to the affected areas. We urge residents to continue to report water related matters to 080 1313 1013 or the Whatsapp line 073 148 3477.&rdquo;
