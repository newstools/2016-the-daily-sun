BUSISIWE Dladla did not join the food stokvel in her area this year.So she was worried about where she would get money to buy food to cook for her visitors on Christmas Day.Then she got a call from Daily Sun telling her that she had won the grocery vouchers competition. The 44-year-old unemployed woman from Umlazi, south of Durban, was ecstatic. She said her prayers were answered.When the SunTeam delivered her voucher she said it couldn&rsquo;t have come at a better time, as she was worried that her family of five would have a dull Christmas.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been entering the competition since 2004. This is the second time that I have won.&ldquo;Last year I won during my birthday month, August, and this year I won again, this time at Christmas.&ldquo;I will now be able to buy cakes, sweets and groceries. &ldquo;After winning last year I decided to take a short break from entering so that other people could win. &ldquo;I started entering again this year and now look! I am a winner again.&rdquo;She said she will make sure that she buys lots of chicken to roast.&ldquo;My sisters and I love chicken very much. I will make sure that there is a lot of it. Busisiwe encouraged other people to enter the competition.&ldquo;I will keep entering because I never miss a copy of the Daily Sun.&ldquo;I love reading the interesting stories that I find in the paper,&rdquo; she said.
