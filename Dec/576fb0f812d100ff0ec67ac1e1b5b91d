DOGS are known to kill birds that land in their yard.But it went the other way when two birds attacked a dog on Thursday in Moiletswane, North West.Rachel Rampati (70) said she was in her house when she heard her dog yelping outside.&ldquo;I rushed outside to check what was wrong and found my dog moaning in pain with two birds surrounding its head. &ldquo;The birds looked scary and angry,&rdquo; she said.Her dog was running around looking for a place to hide from the vicious Indian mynahs.The gogo managed to chase the birds away.&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t fly far, showing that they wanted to continue the fight,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;My dog quickly ran into the house for safety.&rdquo;She said this was not her first dog to be attacked in the same manner.&ldquo;About two months ago I woke up one morning to find that my other dog had an eye missing. &ldquo;At the time I wasn&rsquo;t aware that it had been pecked by these evil birds. I called the SPCA to treat the dog.&rdquo;Gogo said she loves her dogs because they protect her house at night.During the day she keeps her doors and windows closed because she fears for her eyes.&ldquo;When I go out I wear sunglasses to protect my eyes.&rdquo; SPCA Inspector Meshack Matlou said: &ldquo;Birds only eat dead animals but they do sometimes attack dogs.&rdquo;He said the dog that was pecked two months ago was taken to the vet, but the eye couldn&rsquo;t be saved.Matlou also said the SPCA is trying to trace the aggressive birds.
