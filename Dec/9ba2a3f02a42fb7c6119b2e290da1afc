IT MUST have been an amazing sight for the first human to lay eyes on Senegal&rsquo;s Lake Retba.Better known by its French name Lac Rose, the lake is strawberry pink due to the micro-algae in the water.It is also very salty. This must have been upsetting for travellers in ancient times, who would have been slightly angered by the fact that they couldn&rsquo;t drink from the lake. Salt is still harvested from Lac Rose to this day. The lake is also popular with tourists from all over the world.However, it is not wise to swim in the lake. The salty water burns skin, and salt collectors have to take precautions when they go to Lac Rose.
