POPULAR actress and TV presenter Marietjie Bothma has opened up to Daily Sun about the abuse she allegedly suffered at the hands of her former partner. The Afrikaans actress, best known for speaking fluent IsiZulu in a King Pie TV advert, has appeared in several TV shows and was also the MC at President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s inauguration.The SunTeam caught up with Marietjie in Sharpeville, in the Vaal, over the weekend. She was one of the programme directors of the 20th anniversary celebration of the Constitution, at which Zuma addressed residents. The SunTeam asked Marietjie about a Facebook post in which she wrote: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been getting terrible attacks from my ex. He has been posting untrue things about me and nude photos from years ago. Anyone who can give me advice, please inbox me.&rdquo;Marietjie &ndash; who is an ambassador for the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children campaign &ndash; said all women in abusive relationships needed to leave. She told Daily Sun her former partner&rsquo;s alleged cyber-bullying drained her emotionally.&ldquo;I think what is sad is that even when women get out of abusive relationships, the abuse can carry on for years after.&rdquo;She had been separated from her ex-partner for four years, &ldquo;but this never ends&rdquo;. &ldquo;Strong women like myself must be the voice of the voiceless,&rdquo; she said. Marietjie, a speaker at the recent opening of the new sexual offences court in Limpopo, said she reported the nude photos to Facebook and they were eventually taken down. &ldquo;I believe I was a victim, but I have now become a survivor, over-comer and conqueror. I believe my story can help others. Let us break the silence,&rdquo; she said.
