RESIDENTS said it&rsquo;s common in their area for gunshots to be shot into the air at the burials of people who were gunned down. However, the practice turned sour on Sunday at the funeral of Mzawuvuke Mnculwana (44), who was killed in Joburg two weeks before. Three unknown men arrived at his grave site in Mhlangana Village, in the Msinga area of the KZN Midlands, and started shooting randomly at mourners, killing two and injuring five more. Nomusa Mchunu (45) died instantly at the scene, while a second woman (39) died on the way to the hospital.Nomusa&rsquo;s sister-in-law, Thandoluni Mchunu (45) said the gunmen stood around the grave like everyone else. &ldquo;When the coffin was lowered and mourners were singing, we suddenly heard gunshots. We thought they were just shooting into the air but soon seven people were lying on the ground and bleeding.&rdquo; Thandoluni said mourners ran for their lives, leaving the grave uncovered. &ldquo;They reportedly told the cops they were just engaging in the practice we know. However, it&rsquo;s suspected they were drunk as they were holding beer cans.&rdquo; Thandoluni said members of the Mnculwana family later returned to fill the grave with sand. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, KZN police spokeswoman, confirmed the incident. &ldquo;Two cases of murder and five of attempted murder were opened. Three suspects were arrested and will appear in court soon.&rdquo;
