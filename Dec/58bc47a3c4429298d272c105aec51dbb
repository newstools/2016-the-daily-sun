PARLIAMENT&rsquo;S inquiry into the SABC board will continue its work, despite members of the broadcaster walking out of the inquiry in protest today.Mbulaheni Maguvhe, the last remaining board member, on Tuesday launched a late appeal against the High Court's decision to dismiss his request for an interdict last week, ad hoc committee chairperson Vincent Smith revealed.The committee broke for thirty minutes earlier to discuss the way forward."After listening to the legal team, and taking advice from legal counsel, we go back to the point we made when we started, that Parliament would not be deterred from its work," Smith said after their private meeting.Following the resumption of the meeting, Maguvhe laid another complaint.He said the documents the inquiry would be using this week, including the Auditor General's report and the Public Protector's report, were not in Braille, and would "jeopardise" him.Maguvhe is partially blind.Smith replied that SABC secretary Theresa Geldenhuys had notified the committee five days before Maguvhe was scheduled to appear that they would transcribe the documents into Braille, and therefore denied his late request.Smith told the ad hoc committee earlier that the court had not given reasons for its decision to dismiss Maguvhe&rsquo;s request for an interdict."If that is the position, I'm unclear on what basis an appeal could have been made," he had said.Smith said it was the opinion of Parliament's legal counsel to proceed cautiously, with a preference to have Maguvhe&rsquo;s appeal in the High Court heard as soon as possible before proceeding with the hearings.The inquiry is continuing.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/sabc-members-walks-out-of-parliament-inquiry-20161207
