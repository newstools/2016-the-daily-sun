BEFORE Friday, Thandi Dladla&rsquo;s biggest problem was not having money for Christmas clothes for her grandchildren. But today, that problem is minor after the collapse of her home. At the moment gogo Thandi (63), from Magwaveni in Tongaat, north of Durban has no place to call home. Her mud house came crumbling down on Friday while she was relaxing inside. Luckily, she managed to escape in time and was not harmed. Thandi told Daily Sun she was in her sitting-room when she saw one of her bedroom walls collapse. She said: &ldquo;I rushed outside to check what had caused it. As soon as I stepped outside, it collapsed.&ldquo;Luckily I managed to escape death because I wouldn&rsquo;t have survived if it had collapsed on me. I am also grateful that neither of my grandchildren were not in the house at the time.&rdquo; Tearful Thandi said she was grateful for life but worried about how she was going to survive. She said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any money to fix the house. The little I&rsquo;d saved is meant for my grandchildren&rsquo;s school fees in January. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do. At the moment my neighbour has taken us in but we can&rsquo;t stay there forever.&rdquo;Councillor Geoffrey Pullan said he visited the gogo on Saturday and took photos that he will send to various sponsors.&ldquo;I will meeting government officials to come up with a solution,&rdquo; said Pullan.
