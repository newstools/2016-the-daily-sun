WHEN Adam Moyane was born, cuts were made on his body and lion muthi was rubbed into the wounds. Like the rest of his family, Adam grew up as strong as an ox. The 19-year-old from block A near Malelane in Mpumalanga told Daily Sun he never gets sick and believes the muthi he was given as a baby will lead to him staying strong into old age. Adam said his madala Daniel Moyane (88) in Mozambique gave him unbelievable strength when he was born. &ldquo;In my family we are very strong. We don&rsquo;t get sick or die. I have never attended the funeral of a family member.&rdquo; Adam can lift a 20-litre container filled with water with his teeth and also had neighbours stone him to show his strength.He said he could walk the whole day without getting tired. &ldquo;I tell people to hit me with bricks all the time and they are surprised when I do not bleed. Since I came to Mzansi I have noticed people die easily here.&ldquo;My madala&rsquo;s muthi could save many lives,&rdquo; he said.The SunTeam phoned Daniel in Mozambique and he confirmed he has powerful muthi.He said his ancestors showed him the muthi in a dream when rebels killed his parents. &ldquo;I mixed it and gave it to my relatives. Since the 1970s I have not lost one. But it is scarce and I do not give it to strangers.&rdquo;
