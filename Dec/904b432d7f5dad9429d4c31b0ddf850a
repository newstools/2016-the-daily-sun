IN THE early hours of yesterday morning, residents closed all entrances to their kasi with burning tyres and rocks. The people of Umthambeka in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni were furious after 10 families were evicted in extension 11 by the Red Ants on Wednesday morning. According to the protesters, the affected families were told their houses didn&rsquo;t belong to them anymore. Resident Jane Moyo told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been living in these houses for years and our parents used to live here. We&rsquo;re not going anywhere. The mayor must come and explain what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo; After blocking roads, the protesters marched to the councillor&rsquo;s office to hand over a memorandum of grievances. However, they complained that they were refused entry by the police. Jane said: &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t even want to go in there. We want to talk to the mayor. The eviction letters we received had the City of Ekurhuleni&rsquo;s stamp on them.&rdquo; According to residents, people could be evicted from about 2 000 houses. &ldquo;These houses used to belong to Transnet but former employees paid for them with their provident funds when the company left the area. Now we&rsquo;re hearing a company has bought them and we&rsquo;re going to be evicted,&rdquo; said a resident. Mayoral office spokesman Zweli Dlamini said they need to go through the list of grievances before commenting. &ldquo;Appropriate action will be taken and we will meet community leaders to ensure the matter is dealt with,&rdquo; he said.
