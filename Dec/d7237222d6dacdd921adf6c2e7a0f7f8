All I want is closure &ndash; to know what killed my son . On the day of his disappearance, he said he was going with his friends to Springs and he would come back. I last spoke to him just before 11pm on the phone when he told me that he was coming home.&rdquo; When Nomsa tried to call Nhlahla the following morning his phone was off .&ldquo;We reported him missing at the police station and we traced the number of a man who went with my son to Springs .&ldquo;But whenever we called him, he answered without saying a word. Then one day he told us to look for Nhlanhla&rsquo;s body at the Germiston mortuary. We found my son&rsquo;s body there &ndash; 11 days after he disappeared.&rdquo; Nomsa said she gave this in for mation to the investigating officer. Provincial police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubela said Benoni police are investigating a case of murder but they have not made any arrests yet .
