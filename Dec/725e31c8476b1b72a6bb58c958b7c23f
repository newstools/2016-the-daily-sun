THE place is called Promised Land, but the only promise here is that you will suffer hardship.Residents of the squatter camp in Greenfield, Ekurhuleni have been desperately struggling for survival for two months.That&rsquo;s because there is simply no water!&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been two months since we last had water in our communal taps. No one cares. We don&rsquo;t even know why water trucks don&rsquo;t come to our area anymore,&rdquo; said Maria Moloi (55).Maria said she was sick and tired of waiting for the municipality to make plans to get them water. She said it&rsquo;s like living in a desert. &ldquo;Before they cut off our water completely, the only time we&rsquo;d get water was between 2am and 5am. If you missed that time you would have to go to nearby RDPs to ask for water.&rdquo;But as days without water turned into weeks and months, people from the RDPs were no longer willing to share their water for free. Now they charge R5 for a 20 litre bucket.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have money to buy water,&rdquo; said Maria. &ldquo;The irony is that we have flushing toilets in our community. How are we supposed to do that without water? &ldquo;The whole place stinks because people cannot use the little water they have to flush toilets. I have cleaned the one near my shack but I know by the end of the day it will be filled with kak from people I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Maria.Residents said they felt frustrated as it was government that moved them from their previous squatter camp to this one. &ldquo;Life was much easier there and we had everything we needed. Now we&rsquo;ve been abandoned,&rdquo; said one resident.Ekurhuleni municipal spokesman Themba Gadebe said: &ldquo;Based on our knowledge, Greenfields is a proclaimed township in the Alberton area. There is no informal settlement in the area or nearby.&ldquo;But we will send out a team to the area,&rdquo; he said.
