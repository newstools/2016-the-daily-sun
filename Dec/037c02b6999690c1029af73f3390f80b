SIPHO Nyoka (42) was born without arms, but he was used to making his own way around town.On Saturday morning, he rushed to the bus stop near the Jabulani Disabled Centre, hoping to catch a bus to Empangeni CBD.But a few minutes later, Sipho was dead. He was killed by a car as he was sitting on the side of the road waiting for the bus.Mandla Gumede, the supervisor at the centre, told Daily Sun that witnesses said the car had tried to avoid a speeding taxi. He said Sipho could have been saved if he had been able to get up quickly from the rock he was sitting on, but the fact that he had no arms meant he couldn&rsquo;t.Mandla said the sad incident again showed that authorities needed to put speed humps in the area.&ldquo;Taxis are always speeding on this road. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t seem to care that the road is also used by people living with disabilities,&rdquo; said Mandla.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never had an accident before, but I always feared that one day it would happen.&rdquo; He said Sipho was originally from Mondlo in Vryheid, KZN, and came to the centre about seven years ago.Sipho&rsquo;s brother, Themba Nyoka (48) said they were shocked by the way he died.&ldquo;This is very painful. It&rsquo;s going to be difficult to accept that he&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo; He said Sipho moved to the centre after the death of their mother, who looked after him.Captain Nqobile Gwala said Empangeni cops were investigating a case of culpable homicide.
