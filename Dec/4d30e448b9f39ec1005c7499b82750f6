THREE men from Ekunqobeni Village in Maphumulo, outside KwaDukuza, were shot dead on Wednesday night. A fourth person is recovering in hospital after being critically hurt during the attack. The victims were travelling with their taxi boss friend, Mzweleni Mkhwanazi (37), who was a member of the troubled Maphumulo Taxi Association. Sipho Thusi, spokesman for the association, said Mzweleni was driving home from the taxi rank when the incident happened. He was with three other friends &ndash; Wanda Mchunu (32), Bongumusa Ngcobo (29) and Mkhuzeni Mhlongo (29). But Mkhuzeni survived the attack and is recovering in hospital. Sipho said: &ldquo;A group of unknown men allegedly came out of the bush near the road and started shooting at Mzweleni&rsquo;s Toyota Hilux.&rdquo; He said the incident could be related to the ongoing taxi violence between members of Maphumulo and another group of taximen. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a group of people who constantly disrupt our operations. They buy taxis and forcefully operate without following proper procedures.&rdquo; Mzweleni&rsquo;s uncle, Sakhephi Nzuza (61), said that he also believed his nephew&rsquo;s death had something to do with his work.Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said three cases of murder and one of attempted murder were opened at KwaDukuza cop shop.
