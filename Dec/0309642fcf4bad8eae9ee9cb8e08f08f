ENOCH Nzolo and his friend were certainly not expecting anything bad to happen as they drove along in their car. But suddenly a car without lights came charging towards them as they were travelling along Heidelberg Road, near Duduza, Ekurhuleni, last week.The car rammed into them and they were flung off the road and ended up in the bush.Enoch, from Duduza in Ekurhuleni, was injured in the head while his friend, Johnny Kubheka sustained chest injuries.Enoch said the driver of the car hurried towards them but the police were soon on the scene.&ldquo;When he saw the police he went back to his car. He didn&rsquo;t look injured to us.&rdquo; Residents said they have heard of a gang of people who drive around with their lights switched off. If anybody flashes their lights at them they follow that car to rob and kill the occupants.&ldquo;We suspect this incident could be related to that. The world is a scary place and we don&rsquo;t where to hide,&rdquo; said Enoch.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still in pain because I hit the dashboard and some glass cut my head.&rdquo;He said Johnny was badly injured when his chest hit the steering-wheel. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s now in intensive care and we hope he recovers.&rdquo; Sergeant Lerato Mngomezulu said they had not heard of any gang. A case of negligent driving was opened at Duduza Police Station.
