WHEN the people occupied open land at Nellmapius&rsquo; extension 2, they looked forward to spending the festive season in new homes. But the City of Tshwane had other plans! For months, the municipality had been warning the squatters next to Mamelodi, Tshwane that they weren&rsquo;t allowed on the land as it was an illegal land invasion.But the residents still went ahead and put up their shacks. On Wednesday, just days before Christmas, security guards contracted to the city and the Tshwane Metro Police hit the area.All the shacks were destroyed.Despite this, residents remained calm as they collected iron sheets and what was left of their furniture.They vowed to return. Community leader Trevor Monareng said it was heartless of the city to demolish their shacks just before Christmas. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear the municipality does not care about people.&ldquo;How are we going to celebrate when we are homeless and on the street?&ldquo;Lots of people had decorated their homes for Christmas and their children were very excited. All that was taken from them.&rdquo; Trevor said people will occupy the land again because they have nowhere else to go. &ldquo;We are tired of being backyard dwellers while there is empty space all around. &ldquo;Some people here have been waiting for RDPs forever. &ldquo;We will stay here,&rdquo; he said. Merriam Ngoetjana (35) said she didn&rsquo;t know where she would sleep. &ldquo;Before I came to live here, I was renting. When I got this land, I took my rent money and bought a shack and now it has been destroyed, and I don&rsquo;t have rent money,&rdquo; she said. Merriam added she had lost most of her food and furniture. Tshwane Metro police spokesman, Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba, said the cops did not demolish any shacks. &ldquo;The shacks were demolished by a service provider employed by the city of Tshwane. We only came for protection and to ensure there was calm in the area.&rdquo;
