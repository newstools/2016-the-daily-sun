ALTHOUGH stock theft is a headache in many communities, there are still some Good Samaritans. Members of the Moletjie Farmers Association have been collecting stray animals and reporting them to the SAPS stock theft unit so that their owners can collect them before they end up in the hands of thugs. They are now looking for the owner of three sheep that have been roaming around Moletjie Ga-Mphela, Limpopo, for the past two weeks. Phineas Mashiane, the association&rsquo;s co-ordinator, said the sheep had been sleeping in front of residents&rsquo; gates. &ldquo;Our aim is to protect livestock. We noticed that these animals had been without a herder for a long time so we decided to look for their owners. &ldquo;However, no one knows who they belong to. We have reported the matter to the stock theft unit.&rdquo;Last year, the association managed to save eight cows from thugs who had stolen them in the middle of the night. The suspects escaped but the cows were handed over to the cops. They also managed to catch a farmer who was buying cattle in the area with fake cheques. He had scammed a number of people. Johannes Mpsana (52), who is looking after the sheep while the police search for their owner, said: &ldquo;We have many cases of stock theft and we can&rsquo;t just leave other people&rsquo;s animals unattended.&rdquo;Lucky Ramashala, Limpopo stock theft commander, said they were aware of the sheep saved by the association. &ldquo;We contacted our team from the pound. They will collect the animals and keep them safe. &ldquo;We call on anyone who has lost animals to check at our pound.&rdquo;
