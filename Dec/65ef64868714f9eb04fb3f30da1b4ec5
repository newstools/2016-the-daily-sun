A TROOP of baboons is holding madala Joel in a grip of terror. The baboons leave the bush in the morning and go straight to Joel Mbedzi&rsquo;s home. They run wild and begin to fill their huge bellies with his plump chickens. According to madala Joel, the baboons have eaten 25 of his chickens. He said 20 of the chickens have been eaten since the beginning of the year while five of those were feasted on last Monday. He said he&rsquo;s now left with nothing. The 78-year-old from Gunda Tshilate, outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo, told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I live in constant fear of these massive baboons. &ldquo;Every day, they come in the morning looking for something to eat in my yard. When they find me outside the yard, they chase me into the house. I have to lock the door and pray that the baboons don&rsquo;t break in.&rdquo; Joel said when the problem started at the beginning of the year, he would hear his chickens shrieking. He added: &ldquo;I would be too scared to go outside and fight for my chickens because the baboons are very dangerous. I would always have to wait until the baboons had left before checking on my chickens. The problem went on every day until they had eaten my last chicken. Now I have nothing left.&rdquo; Madala Joel is a widower and stays alone in his house. &ldquo;Now that the baboons have chewed all my chickens, they have started eating my mangoes.&rdquo; Thina Nephawe (43) is another victim. He said: &ldquo;We live like prisoners in our own homes. Daily, the baboons break into my kitchen and eat my pap and meat. The baboons are scary and very dangerous. They are huge, hairy and always want something to eat.&rdquo; Asked if he has been able to stop the animals breaking into his kitchen, he said: &ldquo;The baboons are very aggressive. They could kill anyone who stands between them and their food.&rdquo;
