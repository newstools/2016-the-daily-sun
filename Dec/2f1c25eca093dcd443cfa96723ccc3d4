A TRUCK full of cold drinks accidentally delivered early Christmas presents to Midlands residents. Yesterday a truck carrying Coca Cola products overturned on the N3 highway near Hilton in the KZN Midlands after colliding with a bakkie, littering the road with cool drinks. Four people were injured in the crash, which happened about 500m from the Mariannhill Toll Plaza. Shockingly, many motorists and residents looted the truck instead of helping the injured. A resident said: &ldquo;When the truck overturned, my friends and I quickly ran to the road and took whatever we could. &ldquo;The drinks will definitely come in handy this festive season. I will keep some for Christmas. This has lessened the burden of buying Christmas goodies for the family.&rdquo; Traffic was gridlocked for more than three hours as the truck blocked the entire road. Taxi driver Sibusiso Mzolo (32) said: &ldquo;Traffic came to a standstill when the truck crashed. &ldquo;Some people helped themselves to the truck&rsquo;s load. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they won&rsquo;t have to buy any cool drinks for Christmas.&rdquo;ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said four people were injured when the truck and the bakkie collided. &ldquo;The driver of the bakkie and three other occupants sustained minor to moderate injuries. &ldquo;They were treated on the scene before being transported to hospital for further care,&rdquo; he said. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said: &ldquo;No case was opened. &ldquo;However, an accident report was written.&rdquo;
