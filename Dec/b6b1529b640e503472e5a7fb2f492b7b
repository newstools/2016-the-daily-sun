RESIDENTS of Kosovo squatter camp in Samora Machel are picking up the pieces after a fire swept through their area on Tuesday.Nokwayiyo Majola, a single mum, claimed the fire was started by a neighbour who left his stove unattended. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where my children an I will sleep. &ldquo;The fire destroyed all our belongings. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t even save our blankets. &ldquo;We have no idea what we are going to eat,&rdquo; said the sad mum.A number of residents were left with only the clothes on their backs. Some came back from work to the sight of their shacks reduced to a pile of ashes. Bongani Maphuza (46), another resident, said he had already bought Christmas clothes for his four children in Eastern Cape. Sadly, the clothes were burnt to a crisp. Ntlantla Vuthula (7) said his new bicycle was destroyed by the fire. &ldquo;I only rode my bicycle once,&rdquo; said Ntlantla. However, he said he was relieved none of his family members were hurt. Last Saturday six shacks were burnt down in a similar incident when a man left a pot of meat unattended. Resident Nozibele Masiko said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfair. We keep losing our belongings because of one person&rsquo;s stupidity.&rdquo; Theo Layne, spokesman for Cape Town Fire and Rescue services, said: &ldquo;About 100 structures were destroyed.&ldquo;More than 250 residents lost their homes.&ldquo;No injuries were reported. &ldquo;The cause of the fire is still under investigation.&rdquo;
