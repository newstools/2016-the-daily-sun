THUGS in this area target graves. The Mogane family from Boksburg, Ekurhuleni discovered that their loved one&rsquo;s grave had been tampered with. Kenneth Mogane was buried at Boksburg Cemetery in August this year. His mum, Francinah Mogane (73) said her other son, Aubrey (48) visited the grave on Christmas Day. &ldquo;He noticed that Kenneth&rsquo;s grave was covered with fresh soil,&rdquo; she told Daily Sun. &ldquo;We suspect thugs wanted to steal the expensive coffin Kenneth was buried in.&rdquo;Aubrey said thugs target graves that have a sticker of a certain funeral parlour known to offer expensive coffins to its clients. &ldquo;We will not be at peace until we dig up the grave to check whether my brother&rsquo;s body is still in the coffin we bought for him,&rdquo; said Aubrey. Francinah said the incident has left the family shaken and has brought fresh tears. &ldquo;We did not enjoy Christmas Day at all. &ldquo;My son found that all the flowers and traditional things put there on the day of the burial were not there. &ldquo;Instead, the grave appeared to have been dug up,&rdquo; she told the People&rsquo;s Paper. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s even worse is that another grave, not far from Kenneth&rsquo;s grave, has been dug up, leaving the coffin partly exposed. It is a shame that people dig up graves just for money.&rdquo; Francinah said the family has opened a case at the local cop shop. &ldquo;We have also applied to have the grave dug up so that we can know the exact reason why people are digging up graves in that cemetery.&rdquo; Boksburg police spokesman Sergeant Mashudu Phathela said cops were investigating a case of violation of a grave.
