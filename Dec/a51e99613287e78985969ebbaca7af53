ONLY a few weeks after Prophet Lethebo Rabalago sprayed his congregation with Doom, another pastor has surfaced with what he claims to be a miracle treatment.Prophet Rufus Phala of AK Spiritual Christian Church in Makgodu, Limpopo, made his church members drink Dettol.In the video seen by Daily Sun, Prophet Rufus tells the congregation to drink the antiseptic liquid, promising they will be healed of their sickness.&ldquo;I know Dettol is harmful, but God instructed me to use it. I was the first one to drink it,&rdquo; he claimed.He also claimed he has been getting WhatsApp messages from people who say they have been healed.Dr Mabowa Makhomisane, a general practitioner, said Dettol is harmless when mixed with bath water or when cleaning a wound. &ldquo;But if it goes into your stomach and gets absorbed into your body, it decreases the amount of oxygen in your system. This might cause to you collapse and die.&ldquo;If you vomit the liquid into your lungs, it causes aspiration pneumonia. &ldquo;Your lungs will get swollen and you won&rsquo;t be able to breathe.&rdquo;Dr Makhomisane advised the people who drank the liquid to consult a doctor to check whether any damage was done.
