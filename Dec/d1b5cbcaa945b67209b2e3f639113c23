ANDILE Fikizolo reckons Kaizer Chiefs have no chance against Golden Arrows.The attacking midfielder is on top of his game these days and has been a regular starter for Arrows. Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende host Amakhosi in an Absa Premiership clash at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban tonight (6pm) and Fikizolo is raring to go against the struggling Chiefs. He said: &ldquo;We will be fighting for three points &ndash; and I don&rsquo;t see Chiefs leaving with any.&rdquo;The speedy midfielder said their aim in this last game of the year would be to make sure they collect maximum points and fulfil their 15-match target. He added that they had unfinished business with Amakhosi after Chiefs completed the double over Arrows last season, beating them home and away. &ldquo;Our target before the season began was to get 23 points in 15 matches. We will reach that target if we beat Chiefs. We want to come back next year and fight for another 23 points, which will take us to 46. &ldquo;With that total we could certainly make the top eight,&rdquo; said Fikizolo. &ldquo;We understand that things are not going well for Chiefs these days, but that does not concern us. We also know they won their last game (beating Polokwane City 3-2 at home), their first win in a long time, and we didn&rsquo;t win ours. &ldquo;But we are not scared of them. Besides, they owe us. Last time they were here they took all three points from us!&rdquo;Before beating Polokwane City over the weekend, Amakhosi had gone eight matches without a win. Chiefs head coach Steve Komphela will be looking to continue with their newfound winning formula. Arrows, on the other hand, have now gone two games without a win.
