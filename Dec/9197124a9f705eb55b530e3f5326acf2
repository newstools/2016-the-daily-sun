DETAILS have emerged of how the Gupta family allegedly raked in millions of rands by charging companies commissions for tenders. An investigation by non-profit journalism company amaBhungane has revealed that Homix, a Gupta-owned company, was being paid 10% of the money every tender it organised was worth.According to amaBhungane, evidence proving the accusations is contained in court papers filed to the Joburg High Court. The investigation found Homix bank records indicated the company was being used to launder money. The records show the company had very little office space and no salary expenses. In just six months, R144 million flowed into the company and R189 million went out. The money coming in was mostly from communications company Neotel and four other companies, most of which benefitted from Transnet contracts.According to an official report seen by amaBhungane, Homix made 16 transfers worth R66 million to two Hong Kong companies last May. The Reserve Bank got suspicious when money flowing out didn&rsquo;t match claimed imports. It froze at least three transfers at the end of that month.The Gupta family refused to respond to queries, saying amaBhungane often published lies about the family, its businesses and friends.
