THERE was great joy when villagers saw the foundations for RDPs being dug.But their joy was shortlived because the builders soon stopped coming to work on the RDP project in Lekgopung, near Zeerust in the North West.Rumours started spreading that the construction project had failed because workers were not paid. Residents said for a number of months there has been no word from government officials about the housing project.Most of these villagers live in mud houses or shacks.Residents didn&rsquo;t want to be identified as they fear they might upset the local traditional chief. And those working on the project have also remained silent although they also live in shacks. Some of them have allegedly been removed from the list of beneficiaries without valid reasons.Some RDPs were left incomplete in people&rsquo;s yards.Ben Bole, spokesman for the department of local government and human settlements in the province, said the project which started in August last year is expected to be completed in May.&ldquo;The delay was due to prioritisation of beneficiaries by the municipality. &ldquo;The identification of beneficiaries remains the work of the municipality. &ldquo;Our responsibility is to capture beneficiaries in our housing subsidy system for approval. &ldquo;For the record, this project has not stopped,&rdquo; said Bole, adding that there are about 250 low cost housing units still to be built.He said they have asked the contractor to speed up the process. Villagers said they should have been told about this hiccup instead of being left in the dark.
