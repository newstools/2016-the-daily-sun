FIREFIGHTING efforts have been scaled back in Nelson Mandela Bay.The focus has shifted to cleaning up and damage assessment. This is after a fire ripped through residential areas, fuelled by gale force winds on Tuesday.Mayoral chief of staff, Kristoff Adelbert, said firefighters were still checking hot spots for flare-ups and the municipality was seeing how much damage was done.It is not yet known how the fire started at about 3pm on Tuesday in Chelsea before blazing its way to Kamma Heights and Lorraine, fanned by the strong wind.Residents were told to evacuate, including those at an old-age home. No injuries were reported.&ldquo;A single thatched roof home was burnt to the ground in Chelsea. &ldquo;The cause of fire is yet to be established,&rdquo; said Adelbert.Mayoral committee member for safety and security, John Best, said 24 firefighters and six fire engines were sent to fight the blaze while volunteers from Working in Fire, Kragga Kamma Game Park and Lorraine Neighbourhood Watch assisted them. He said the dry and windy conditions caused the fire to spread.Best added that many emergency vehicles struggled to reach certain areas as onlookers meant traffic was blocked. Mayor Athol Trollip appealed to residents for water and food donations to assist those affected and thanked all who assisted in fighting the fire.
