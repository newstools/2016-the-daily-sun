THEIR dreams of a happy Christmas have gone up in smoke.The Sithole family from Dark City outside Thulamahashe in Mpumalanga woke up to find the main house in the yard had almost burnt to the ground and the clothes and food meant for Christmas had been burnt to ashes.Florence Sithole (42) said they all went to their separate rooms after having dinner in the main house on Sunday night. She said for some reason everybody fell into a deep sleep until they woke up at 8am the next day. They didn&rsquo;t smell the smoke or see the flames that had engulfed the house during the night. Florence said not even their neighbours saw the fire.&ldquo;The evil flames ate our groceries and clothes meant for Christmas. &ldquo;Our furniture worth about R19 500 was also destroyed. I don&rsquo;t know what to do now.&rdquo; &ldquo;Everything was in order when we left the main house to go to sleep in our rooms.&ldquo;We were all fast asleep and heard nothing. We woke up in the morning to find that the house was burnt.&ldquo;We believe some evil forces made us sleep so deeply so that vutha could destroy our home.&rdquo;Aubrey Mnisi, Bushbuckridge Municipality spokesman, said they were not aware of the matter. &ldquo;We will send a team to investigate and assist where necessary.&rdquo; Constable Sonile Usinga, Mhala police spokesman, confirmed the police received a complaint from the family about fire and an inquiry was opened. Traditional healer Dr Annuary Ndlovu said the family must consult a powerful sangoma or prophet for protection.
