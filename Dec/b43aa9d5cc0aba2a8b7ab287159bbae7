SHE once thought he was the love of her life. But now she fears he&rsquo;s going to be the one to end her life!Yvonne Pule (52) claims she lives in fear of her ex-husband who she says is trying to kill her. She told Daily Sun: &ldquo;He has turned my life into a nightmare. When I met him in 1997 he seemed like a very kind person and we soon fell madly in love. We married in 2002.&rdquo;But as the marriage progressed, she claimed, her husband started revealing his true colours and became very abusive.&ldquo;I lived a life of hell for over 13 years. &ldquo;He changed into a complete monster. &ldquo;He would beat me up every day for no reason. Every time he said if I told anyone he would kill me. He would often target my body so my injuries wouldn&rsquo;t be visible.&rdquo;A fed-up Yvonne filed for divorce in 2014, but things went from bad to worse. &ldquo;He became even more obsessed and violent. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d come to my house and still beat me up and again threatened to kill me. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when I went to the police station to get a protection order. But it didn&rsquo;t help. &ldquo;He sends people to my house to break my windows and has also started stalking me, following my every move. He calls me and tells me my every move during the day. &ldquo;Last month my car was shot at, I suspect he was responsible.&rdquo;Daily Sun called her ex-husband, Paul Qacha, who said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested in what that women says. She can continue with her lies all she wants, but I won&rsquo;t entertain her stories.&ldquo;I have nothing more to say.&rdquo;Captain Kay Makhubela said Yvonne should go to the station where the protection order was obtained. She should speak to the station commander to report her ex-husband&rsquo;s conduct it and open an intimidation case.
