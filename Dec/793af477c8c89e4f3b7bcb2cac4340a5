ANOTHER two people have been killed by lightning in KZN. Cousins Msawenkosi Makhathini (12) and Sthandiwe Ndlovu (10) of Mzulwini Village in Maphumulo were struck while sleeping on Thursday night.This comes a month after two siblings were killed by lightning in Zibambele Village, Nongoma. Sthandiwe&rsquo;s mum, Thulisiwe Makhathini (37), told Daily Sun the sudden deaths had devastated the family. &ldquo;We are still shocked. My mum, who was in the house when the lightning struck, doesn&rsquo;t even want to talk about it. &ldquo;I was sleeping in another house on the same property that night. My mum knocked on the door to wake me up. She told me to come to their house as she had seen a fireball entering one of the windows. We rushed to the kids&rsquo; bedroom and discovered they were dead,&rdquo; said Thulisiwe. She said Thobeka Ndlovu (13) was admitted to Stanger Hospital with serious injuries. Four other kids who were sleeping in the same room sustained minor injuries. The lightning didn&rsquo;t destroy anything in the house. Co-operative governance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube last month revealed there had been 25 deaths caused by lightning in the province this year.
