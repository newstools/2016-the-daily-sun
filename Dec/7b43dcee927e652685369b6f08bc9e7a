THE FACTSGODFREY Kwanaite from Mapetla in Soweto wanted to know if there are funds in his late mother&rsquo;s bank account. WHAT I DIDI contacted Absa Bank. SOLUTIONFaith Manjoro from the bank checked and said the account only had R41,86 left. He advised Godfrey to close the account because it would cost more to open a deceased account than he would get out. Godfrey agreed for the account to be closed and for the balance to go into unclaimed funds. He is happy to know it is sorted out.
