WHEN the lightning struck on Thursday night, Xitsonga singer Petros Nyathi&rsquo;s entire house went completely dark.But seconds later, the thunderbolt returned . . it cut through the main door like a sword and headed straight for the terrified family of 14 members huddling together in the sitting-room. Then the white flame paused, and moved back as quickly as it had come. But if the family from the Greater Manyeleti area near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, thought the worst was over, they were in for a big shock. When they went outside, they found three cows dead in the kraal.Petros&rsquo; brother, Morgan (20), said the family was watching TV when the incident occurred.Petros &ndash; who was not home at the time &ndash; said the lightning could have killed his eight kids, three wives and four younger brothers.His parents Eliza (61) and Romeo (69) said jealous people had sent the lightning to kill their son&rsquo;s family.&ldquo;Jealous people are not happy with my son&rsquo;s success. He worked hard to build his 14-roomed house. He has cows and fleet of cars.&rdquo; Sangoma Dr Annuary Ndlovu said this could be a wake-up call for the family to consult a powerful prophet or sangoma for protection.
