UKHOZI FM DJ Ngizwe Mchunu&rsquo;s first wife, Lindi Khuzwayo-Mchunu, is allegedly having a tough time accepting her spouse has a second wife.Sources close to the situation told Sunday Sun Floda Mthimkhulu, Ngizwe&rsquo;s new-wife and a musician signed to DJ Tira&rsquo;s Afrotainment record label, was the flavour of the moment in this love triangle.So bad is Lindi&rsquo;s dilemma, she has allegedly turned into a stalker who shadows her hubby&rsquo;s every move after learning wife No 2 will be in his company.A source even alleged last Saturday&rsquo;s maskandi event at the Greyville Racecourse in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, was the most recent cause of Lindi&rsquo;s heebie-jeebies.&ldquo;Lindi gatecrashed the event, but her timing was awful because Ngizwe was already seated in the VIP area with his new squeeze,&rdquo; the source said.&ldquo;She keeps spying on Ngizwe, only to get egg on her face as Floda&rsquo;s always with him.&rdquo;The source claimed Lindi had to grow up and accept the reality of the presence of wife No 2 in her marriage.Asked for comment, an agitated Lindi said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care that they were together because I was there to enjoy myself. Ngizwe can be with her, I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;Ngizwe was defensive when asked for his version of the events.&ldquo;Please, leave my wives alone,&rdquo; he said.But Floda played the pleasant card, saying: &ldquo;I have no problem with her. She could have joined us in the VIP area.&rdquo;The sources said Lindi feels left out and disrespected to an extent that she had started to stalk her husband. The moles closed to the couple said Lindi follows Ngizwe if she hears that he&rsquo;s to be accompanied by Floda. The source said the recent incident happened on Saturday last week, at Durban&rsquo;s Greyville course where the maskandi show Ondabuzekwayo was held. &ldquo;Lindi gatecrashed into the event. But her timing was wrong because Ngizwe was already seated in the VIP area with his new customary wife, Floda,&rdquo; said a source. A source said Lindi was so angry and disappointed. &ldquo;She has not accepted the fact that Ngizwe got married to Floda. She fought so hard trying to separate them but she failed. Now all she does is to spy on Ngizwe, following him and getting disappointed because Ngizwe is always with Floda. She must accept that she is no longer the favourite,&rdquo; said the source. Another source said, Lindi tried to force her way to the VIP area but she was blocked by a security. Disappointed and looking sad she kept looking at Ngizwe and Floda&rsquo;s direction. But they had no time for her as they kept whispering sweet something on each other&rsquo;s ear. Ngizwe then sarcastically went on stage and sang &ldquo;I have an angel that loves women.&rdquo; His UKhozi co-presenter Bheka Mchunu responded by saying &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not an angel but a demon.&rdquo; To ease the pain of being rejected, Lindi ended up drinking and dancing with the crowd as if nothing has happened. Lindi told Sunday Sun: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care that they were together because I was there to enjoy myself. Ngizwe can be with her I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo; Ngizwe said: &ldquo;Please leave my wives alone.&rdquo; Floda said: &ldquo;I have no problem with her. She could have joined us at the VIP area.&rdquo;
