NEIGHBOURS have expressed their shock following the slow and painful death of a disabled 55-year-old woman on Friday.Dumisile Ndwandwe was burned to death inside her house in Isilovo Village near Ngwelezane, in northern KZN.A neighbour claimed it&rsquo;s unbelievable that members of the Ndwandwe family said that they did not notice that Dumisile&rsquo;s house was on fire.The neighbour claimed the family said they were busy when the incident occurred.&ldquo;Dumisile couldn&rsquo;t walk properly because she lost one of her legs due to diabetes complications a few years ago. &ldquo;We are shocked that she was alone when the fire broke out because her condition required that she was looked after all the time,&rdquo; said the neighbour.Councillor Madlinyoka Ntanzi &ndash; who visited the family &ndash; said the family told him that they had gathered at another family house which is a few metres away. &ldquo;They told me that they suspect that a candle may have fallen and caused the fire that ate Dumisile. &ldquo;They said by the time they noticed huge flames and dark smoke, it was too late to save her,&rdquo; said Ntanzi.He said one of Dumisile&rsquo;s grandkids was injured by the flames when he tried to get inside the burning house.When contacted, one of Dumisile&rsquo;s grandkids, Sthembiso, said he was busy and asked for a contact number where he could reach the SunTeam later, but he never did. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that an inquest docket is being investigated by Empangeni cops.&ldquo;It is alleged that on Friday at about 8.45pm, a 55-year-old woman was burnt to death inside a house in the Ngwelezana area.&ldquo;Circumstances surrounding the incident are still being investigated,&rdquo; said Gwala.
