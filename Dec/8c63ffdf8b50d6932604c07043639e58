WHEN they moved into their new RDP houses in 2012, they thought all their suffering was over. But in 2014 the walls in the houses started to crack, and now the residents are worried that the houses might one day fall in on them. The angry people of Amaoti, north of Durban, want eThekwini Municipality to resolve the matter. The residents claimed they have complained several times to the municipality but their concerns have fallen on deaf ears. Zethu Jafta (29) told Daily Sun there are many faults in her house. &ldquo;My house has cracks inside and out and the roof leaks when it rains. &ldquo;Some residents have even tried to fix the cracks, but with no luck. When we moved into the houses we thought our problems were over, but it&rsquo;s now back to square one for us.&rdquo; She said that she is worried that her house might collapse if the matter is not resolved. Another resident, Nomakhosi Gazu (46), said she has experienced the same problems at her house. &ldquo;We have complained many times but nothing is done.&rdquo; Councillor Bongani Qhansi confirmed to Daily Sun that he has received complaints from residents. &ldquo;I went to see for myself what they were talking about,&rdquo; said Qhansi.&ldquo;Their situation is bad. It&rsquo;s clear that something needs to be done as soon as possible.&rdquo; He said that he has submitted a report to the department of human settlements. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make sure that I follow up the matter with the department.&rdquo; said Qhansi. Tozi Mthethwa, spokeswoman for eThekwini Municipality, said: &ldquo;The relevant unit is investigating the matter. &ldquo;The results of the investigation will determine the necessary action to be taken.&rdquo;
