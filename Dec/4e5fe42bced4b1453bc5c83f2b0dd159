THE Free State traffic cops were on patrol when they stopped a bakkie with broken lights. The driver (28) was found in possession of dagga worth about R15 000 on the N8 road, near Thaba Nchu, on Tuesday. Kabelo Moloabi, chief provincial inspector, said the two traffic cops were patrolling when they spotted a white Tata bakkie. Moloabi told Daily Sun: &ldquo;The officers stopped the bakkie, which was travelling between Thaba Nchu and Botshabelo to Bloemfontein. While they were inspecting the car for road worthiness, they discovered dagga weighing about 7kg. &ldquo;The driver, who is a Lesotho man (28), was driving alone and didn&rsquo;t have a driver&rsquo;s licence. &ldquo;His bakkie&rsquo;s rear lights were also not working. He was arrested for possession of illegal substances, and was fined for driving without a licence and driving a vehicle with defective rear lights.&rdquo;Police spokeswoman Sergeant Sinah Mpakane confirmed the incident. He said the suspect will appear in the Botshabelo Magistrates Court soon.
