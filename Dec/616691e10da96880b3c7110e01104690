TEBELLO Pitso feels as if his boy was severely injured just yesterday. The 32-year-old&rsquo;s life changed forever in February when his son was left mentally disabled after being run over by a neighbour.Tebello told Daily Sun at first the neighbour admitted to being in the wrong when he accidentally ran over the child, but later he changed his story.The sad dad said the neighbour soon started making excuses and saying the child shouldn&rsquo;t have been playing outside his house. As a result of the accident, which took place in Sharpeville in the Vaal, Tebello&rsquo;s three-year-old son was left unable to even talk.&ldquo;He had gone to play with the neighbour&rsquo;s son. My wife was watching them. Minutes after they went out, I heard screaming and my son crying,&rdquo; said Tebello. &ldquo;I found out my neighbour had driven over my son! &ldquo;While he was at the scene, he said he was sorry but he later started asking what the child was doing in his yard, even though our kids played together often. &ldquo;We want justice for what was pure negligence on his part.&rdquo; After the tragedy, Tebello moved his family to Bophelong because he couldn&rsquo;t stand seeing the neighbour, who used to be his friend. Tebello said he and his wife opened a case with the police. The Sharpeville cops confirmed a case of negligence was being investigated.
