FIGHTING members of the Thembu royal family have been asked to make peace following the shocking death of one of their family.On Saturday, Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders chairman and Thembu Chief Ngangomhlaba Matanzima called on the Mtirara brothers and the senior AmaDlomo family to unite. Brothers and chiefs Thanduxolo and Thandisizwe Mtirara sat next to each other for the first time in many years during the funeral of their brother Daludumo.The funeral was held in Xhongora Village, outside Mthatha. The 51-year-old was found dead at his Tshwane home after apparently committing suicide two weeks ago. He&rsquo;s believed to have taken his life just hours before his enemy&rsquo;s son, Azenathi Dalindyebo, was crowned as acting king. Azenathi is the son of jailed King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo. Chief Matanzima said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to know that everyone makes mistakes. The world is greedy and brothers can end up stabbing each other.&rdquo; Daludumo&rsquo;s daughter, Inga, said he had been a great father who lived to take care of his family. Chief Mkhanyiseli Dudumayo, a member of the Congress of Traditional Leaders, said Daludumo was passionate about his people and his strong leadership would be missed. He is survived by his mum, two brothers, one sister, his wife and three children.
