A BAN was placed on illegal initiation schools in the Vaal, south of Joburg but defiant operators ignored it. So the police decided to act. Massive raids were carried out across the area at the weekend. Police torched several initiation camps in the Toreng hills outside Sebokeng. SunMan SIFISO JIMTA captured the images.
