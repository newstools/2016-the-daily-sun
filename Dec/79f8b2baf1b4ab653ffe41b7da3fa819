HE HAS been on the run for six long years.Justice has finally caught up with the 24-year-old alleged rapist, yet he wants to be granted bail so he does not have to spend Christmas behind bars. &ldquo;My mum is sick and no one is taking care of her,&rdquo; he told the Mhala Magistrates Court. "She will die if I remain in prison.&rdquo;The man, of Mariveni Village near Tzaneen in Limpopo, allegedly raped two girls aged 14 and 15 in Zola extension near Thulamahashe in 2010, with his friend Bonginkosi Mthavini, who is serving a life sentence.Warrant Officer Norah Dumisa said the two initially proposed love to the girls, but were rejected.&ldquo;They then attacked the girls and dragged them to a railway line in Zola extension, where they raped them,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The girl he raped is still traumatised by the incident. The accused has been at large since then. &ldquo;He always evaded cops when we came to his home. He already knew his friend was serving a life sentence for the crime.&rdquo;Dumisa said the same man was accused of rape as a teenager, but could not be jailed because he was a minor. Magistrate Fortune Mhlaba said the accused is a flight risk as cops have hunted for him since 2010. He denied him bail and postponed the case to 30 January.
