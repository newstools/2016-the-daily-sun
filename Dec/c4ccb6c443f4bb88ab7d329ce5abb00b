SHE waited 12 years to be allowed to move into her house.And now that Sindisiwe Langa&rsquo;s wish has been granted, she is afraid.The 51-year-old from KwaMashu, north of Durban finally won her house after a long battle. And on Thursday, a man who had been occupying her four-roomed house in G section was evicted.Sindisiwe told Daily Sun that she bought the house from its owner in 2004 for R80 000 but never moved in because the man she didn&rsquo;t know claimed to have also bought the house that same year. &ldquo;The man refused to move out and told me the house also belonged to him.&ldquo;That was the beginning of the long battle. I later heard that he was renting out the house.&ldquo;And then later on heard that his son had moved in with his wife.&rdquo; She said the man told her he bought the house from the husband of the woman she bought the house from, but he didn&rsquo;t finish paying for it.&ldquo;I asked the woman if she was aware that someone else had bought the house.&ldquo;She told me the man bought the house from her husband but never finished paying for it.&ldquo;I decided to take the matter to court in 2012 because I had the title deed with me,&rdquo; she said.Sindisiwe said since 2012 they have been fighting over the house.&ldquo;I won the case in April. The court instructed him to move out,&rdquo; she said.She said the 12 years have been the hardest time of her life.&ldquo;I have been moving from one shack to another. I bought the house while I was working but now I am unemployed and things are hard for me,&rdquo; she said.The man said he was not aware of the eviction.
