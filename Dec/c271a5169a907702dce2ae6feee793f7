BEAUTY sometimes comes at a high cost &ndash; and possibly also a painful one! This was proved at the weekend when a policewoman, expected to uphold the law, neglected to follow the rules &ndash; all in the name of beauty. The officer, who looked beautiful in her Afro weave, was not wearing her police cap.&nbsp; Instead of wearing the cap, the cop, who had responded to a crime scene, opted to carry it tied at her waist.&nbsp; She was one of the cops in Mangaung, Free State, who had responded to a crime scene at which a baby was found dumped last week.&nbsp; The officer had broken one of the most important rules of the SAPS: to wear the cap at all times when in full uniform.&nbsp; What is even worse is that the officer did not have her name tag or bulletproof vest on.&nbsp; Another cop told Daily Sun that her brother, who is also an officer in Gauteng, was charged for not having his name tag on.&nbsp; &ldquo;But this woman, who has hair similar to Pitch Black Afro, has not been charged,&rdquo; said the cop. &ldquo;She had no vest on, no name tag and a hairstyle that is not allowed &ndash; but she still got away with it!&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not understand how the system works.&nbsp; &ldquo;It seems that some members are the seniors&rsquo; favourites and they can do as they please.&rdquo;&nbsp; Free State police spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Thandi Mbambo said: &ldquo;The huge hairstyle is not allowed when one is in uniform.&nbsp; &ldquo;The hair must be able to fit in under the cap and it must be well wrapped in a pony tail.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mbambo told the People&rsquo;s Paper that the matter had been brought to the attention of the Mangaung cluster commander, Major-General Solly Lesia, who had promised to launch an investigation.
