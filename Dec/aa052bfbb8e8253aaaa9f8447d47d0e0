THE death toll from a blaze that gutted a California warehouse during a rave party has climbed to 30 and is expected to rise.The fire started on Friday at about 11.30pm. The party, featuring electronic dance music, was attended by dozens of people. Authorities said they did not suspect arson, but cops want to find out if the building, which was partitioned into artists&rsquo; studios, had a history of code violations. The party took place on the second floor of the building, which had just two exits, officials said. There was no evidence of any smoke detectors or sprinklers. &ldquo;We have confirmed that the number of dead people is 30. That is a big number,&rdquo; said Sergeant Ray Kelly of the Alameda County sheriff&rsquo;s department.Authorities had only searched a small part of the two-story building. &ldquo;We are still not done. They are working and pulling this building apart and dissecting it. And we&rsquo;re really starting to get deeper into the building. As we do that, we continue to find more victims. In terms of the number of people who are still missing, yes, it&rsquo;s a significant number,&rdquo; said Kelly.He said the recovery operation had been delayed for hours until workers could enter safely. &ldquo;The roof had collapsed onto the second floor and in some spots, the second story had fallen onto the first. Firefighters have gone through the building searching the debris.&rdquo; &ndash; AL JAZEERA
