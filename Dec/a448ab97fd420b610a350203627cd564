CRIMINAL activities often peak over holidays when people are in good spirits and let their guard down. &ldquo;We are far more exposed to cyber crime than we think and the criminals are becoming smarter. But there are a few common-sense things we can do that will make it much more difficult for criminals to take advantage of us,&rdquo; says Jacqueline Fick, Cell C&rsquo;s executive head of forensic services.Social mediaFacebook and Twitter are a great source of information for criminals. An innocent location &ldquo;check in&rdquo; post on a social media platform can inform criminals who are looking for an open house to target. Check your privacy settings so your posts do not land in the wrong hands. If you prefer an open profile, avoid &ldquo;checking in&rdquo; with your location. Fakes for the holidayWatch out for fake correspondence, pretending to be from an institution such as a bank or tax office. These often pop up during this period because we are focused on fun, not banking or taxes. Do not click on links in such messages. Rather contact the institution through numbers listed on their websites.Never share your personal informationUnless you are 100% sure of who you are handing your information to, never provide your personal details. If you think your details have been stolen, change all your passwords immediately and contact your bank, credit card and all your other service providers. Public is publicSometimes we use a public internet cafe or even a WiFi hotspot to check our internet banking or buy something online. When you do, you are exposing your personal information. Using your own mobile data or a secure WiFi connection is a safer way to go. Be awareDo not use your card or banking details on sites you don&rsquo;t trust. Always make a note of the websites you use. Check your credit card statement &ndash; if you see anything unusual, contact the bank.
