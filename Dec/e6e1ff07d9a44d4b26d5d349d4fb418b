But his love of his gang made him forget he was a wanted man!He let his guard down &ndash; and made a mistake that cost him his freedom and landed him behind bars. On Thursday police arrested him at the New Law Courts in Port Elizabeth, Nelson Mandela Bay.He had gone there to support some of his fellow gang members who were appearing in court.Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said: &ldquo;A 26-year-old man was arrested at the New Law Courts on Thursday. &ldquo;He is a member of the Upstand Dogs gang.&ldquo;The suspect went to the court to see fellow gang members, who were appearing on previously remanded cases. &ldquo;Members from the provincial gang investigation unit spotted the suspect and arrested him.&rdquo;The suspect was wanted in connection with two attempted murders, which happened last month.&ldquo;Last month the suspect and his two friends fired at a 19-year-old teenager and his two friends as they were walking along Martin Street in Helenvale. &ldquo;No injuries were reported.&ldquo;About a week later, a 28-year-old man was shot several times at the corner of Reginald and Scott streets, also in Helenvale.&ldquo;The suspect was allegedly involved in both incidents. &ldquo;He will appear in court today on two charges of attempted murder.&rdquo;
