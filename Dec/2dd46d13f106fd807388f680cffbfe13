EVERY night the 72-year-old gogo goes to bed wondering if her old mud house is going to crush her in her sleep, or worse, if she will be attacked by nyaope boys.The gogo said she applied for an RDP many years ago but she still lives in her mud hut in Taung, North West. She told Daily Sun she lives with her son but he is often away and she is left alone, leaving her an easy target for drunks from the taverns. She claims she has been raped in the past.She said contractors have built houses for other people in the area. They allegedly told her they can&rsquo;t build in her yard because she has to remove the rocks first.Her younger brother confirmed that the gogo was raped by nyaope addicts. &ldquo;Once a beer bottle belonging to those boys was found after she had been raped. &ldquo;Police came but nothing happened although a case was opened.&ldquo;What our government is doing to her is unbearable. There are two RDP homes next to our chief&rsquo;s home but these have been rented out to contractors.&rdquo; Human settlements spokesman Ben Bole said the provincial government is responsible for RDPs but is unaware of the gogo&rsquo;s situation. &ldquo;She is not on our housing subsidy system, which indicates she did not apply for an RDP. &ldquo;But we will send a housing inspector to investigate and report back on her situation,&rdquo; he said.SAPS spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said the cops are aware of a rape case. &ldquo;The scene was thoroughly processed, including checking the bottle. &ldquo;We have not been able to arrest a suspect but we are arranging for the gogo to be taken to a place of safety.&rdquo;
