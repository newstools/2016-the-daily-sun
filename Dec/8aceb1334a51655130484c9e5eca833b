In the end, the woman handed herself over to the police, who arrested her.These allegations come from the dead woman&rsquo;s mother. She said she&rsquo;s happy that her ancestors brought justice to a woman who thought she could walk away from a terrible crime.Thokozile Mbila from Slovoville, Roodepoort, Gauteng claimed a jealous woman killed her daughter, Fikile Mbila (32). &ldquo;My daughter was sitting in my tavern. A woman came in and accused Fikile of having an affair with one of the men in the tavern, and a fight started. &ldquo;Fikile was with her boyfriend. There was no way she was having an affair with any other man. &ldquo;When other men tried to stop the killer, she threw stones at them and was very angry.&ldquo;The woman stabbed my daughter to death and ran away,&rdquo; Thokozile said.&ldquo;It took three months before she went to the police. She said she was not at peace and needed to face justice. &ldquo;I am happy that she was arrested and hope she will stay in prison for a long time for what she did to my daughter.&rdquo;She said the suspect&rsquo;s family promised to come and perform a cleansing ceremony, but it never happened. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t show any remorse or sympathy,&rdquo; Thokozile said.&ldquo;I believe that the spirit of my daughter was troubling the suspect and her family, so she took herself in to the police.&rdquo;Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubela said the police are still investigating a case of murder. The suspect is in custody and was charged.She will appear in court soon.
