THE FACTSGODFREY Kwanaite from Mapetla in Soweto was involved in a car accident with his two brothers. The Road Accident Fund didn&rsquo;t pay out, so he came to SunDefender. WHAT I DID I contacted the fund to check on the progress of his claim. SOLUTION It emerged that Godfrey made his claim through an attorney and it had already been paid out. The fund said when a person makes a claim through an attorney, the fund cannot be held liable if the attorney doesn&rsquo;t pay it over to the client. Godfrey will have to report the attorney to the Law Society of South Africa.
