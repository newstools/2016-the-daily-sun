THE sign at their gate says it all: &ldquo;No one is allowed to enter the Nkabinde yard wearing shoes.&rdquo;It&rsquo;s an order given to the family by God himself, they say, with an added warning that should anyone go against it, it would spell disaster &ndash; or even death &ndash; for the family.And when visitors disrespected it, that&rsquo;s exactly what happened!The family said first they lost their son Robert (38), who they claimed died mysteriously last year, and in August their daughter Zinhle (27).The family from Block C near Malalane in Mpumalanga blames the deaths on visitors who disrespected their wishes. &ldquo;Our neighbours and some of our relatives say we&rsquo;re crazy and refuse to pay any attention to the sign at the gate,&rdquo; said Nokuthula Nkabinde (55).&ldquo;Some tell us that they enter the yard wearing shoes simply to see what will happen. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t understand that we were guided by God to do this. We are a religious family and God speaks through us daily. But to some people, we are just crazy.&rdquo;Since the deaths, the family has kept the gate locked.Gogo Sarah Qobo (86) said she received direct messages from God. One of the messages she received 20 years ago was to leave her husband. But the gogo&rsquo;s ex-husband, who did not want to be named, claimed the family was mad. Neighbour Amos Nkuna (37) claimed the family is out of touch with reality.
