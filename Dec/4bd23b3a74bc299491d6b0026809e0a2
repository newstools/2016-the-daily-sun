NONKULULEKO Ngcobo&rsquo;s death on Wednesday devastated her family, especially her mum. Nonkululeko (22) died two months after a shocking church accident. She had attended a church service at the New Christian Church in Zion where the pastor was trying to heal a sick man with a mixture of petrol, paraffin and methylated spirits. The mixture exploded in Nonkululeko&rsquo;s direction, fuelled by a candle the pastor was carrying. Nonkululeko&rsquo;s shocked mum, Nonhlanhla Gcwensa (48), from KwaMpumuza Village in Pietermaritzburg, said nurses claimed her daughter died from smoke inhalation. &ldquo;They told me she had a chest infection.&rdquo;Pastor Petros Shelembe was arrested and charged with attempted murder.He was found not guilty. &ldquo;The magistrate said he didn&rsquo;t burn my daughter on purpose.&rdquo; But now that her daughter has died, Nonhlanhla wants the pastor to be held liable for her daughter&rsquo;s death.&ldquo;I want justice to prevail and the only way is by making sure the pastor goes to jail. Otherwise he has to take care of Nonkululeko&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;Shelembe said: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t owe each other anything. Don&rsquo;t phone me again.&rdquo;Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed a case of attempted murder was opened but later withdrawn after the court ruled that the pastor was not guilty. &ldquo;If Nonhlanhla believes the matter didn&rsquo;t receive the justice it deserved, we advise her to call the NPA.&rdquo; NPA spokeswoman Natasha Kara said: &ldquo;She must submit a written letter to the Director of Public Prosecutions so the matter can be reviewed.&rdquo;
