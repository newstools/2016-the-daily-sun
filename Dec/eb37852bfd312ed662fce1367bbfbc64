MAKWENDA Ralarala was known to win whenever he played dice ekasi. But on Friday he won for the last time. He was stabbed to death, allegedly by people he knew. Tshepo Maponya (35), a long-time friend of Makwenda, was with him when he died in Alexandra, in northern Joburg. &ldquo;The men who killed him couldn&rsquo;t accept that they had lost their money, which they had hoped to double. They picked a fight with him and I tried to separate them, but they moered me as well,&rdquo; said Tshepo. He said that the two men then went to the police station to open a case against Makwenda. &ldquo;We followed them to the cop shop. We argued at the police station and they beat me in front of the cops,&rdquo; said Tshepo. &ldquo;No case was opened but a heated argument started after we left the cop shop. The two men wanted to buy beer and they demanded money from Makwenda. &ldquo;When he refused they stabbed him to death.&rdquo;Makwenda&rsquo;s mum, Nopumzile (57) said her son was the light of her family and his death has shocked them.&ldquo;He just started work last week and he was the hope of the family. I have never had an issue with people coming to my house to complain about him. I don&rsquo;t know why they killed him,&rdquo; she said. Nopumzile said she wanted the killers to face the full might of the law. &ldquo;I want the police to arrest the suspects, who have since fled.&rdquo; Alexandra police spokesman Captain Mohlaume Mamaboro confirmed the incident. He said a murder case was opened and the suspects were at large. &ldquo;Anyone with information about the suspects should come forward.&rdquo;
