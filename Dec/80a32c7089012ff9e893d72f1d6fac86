NATIONAL Under-20 netball coaches, Jenny van Dyk and Dumisani Chauke, will be hoping to lead their side to glory at this year&rsquo;s Africa Union Sports Council Region 5 Games in Luanda, Angola.The tournament, now in its seventh year, kicked off on Friday and will run until 19 December.In the last edition, the junior netball side lost in the final to Zimbabwe in 2014, but they will be looking to do better at this year&rsquo;s tournament, ahead of next year&rsquo;s Netball World Youth Cup set for Gaborone, in Botswana.Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia are the other countries taking part at this year&rsquo;s regional games.Van Dyk reckons neighbours, Zimbabwe will be their toughest opponents in the tournament.Players were picked from different provinces, and most play in the Varsity Netball tournament and the Spar Netball Championship, where they were observed with their contributions for their respective teams.KwaZulu-Natal and North West are the most represented provinces, who have three players each.Van Dyk told the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee: &ldquo;Once again, I think it&rsquo;ll be Zimbabwe who are our toughest test, but at least this time it&rsquo;s on neutral territory. We&rsquo;ve got a talented group of players here, spread evenly among the provinces.&rdquo;Chauke, who is the assistant coach for the Baby Proteas, will be keeping an eye out for players to make the final squad for the global competition.Both Chauke and national Under-21 head coach, Dorette Badenhorst, will be hoping the game time players get from the Region 5 Games will help when they start with preparations for the Youth World Cup early next year.But, netball is not the only sport represented at the competition, national Under-20 women&rsquo;s football, tennis, swimming, athletics and boxing are the other sports that South Africa will also be hoping to bring medals.Squad:Bianca Blom, Danelle Lochner, Jasmine Ziegelmeier, Jessica du Plessis, Nicole Amiras, Nonsikelelo Mazibuko, Nozipho Ntshangase, Simone Rabie, Sinethemba Mkhize, Zandri Vermeulen and Bongise Wete.
