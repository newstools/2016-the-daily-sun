Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela has suggested that he will sign a striker to solve his side's goalscoring problems during the January transfer window.The Soweto giants moved into fourth position on the Premiership table following their 2-0 victory against Golden Arrows on Wednesday, but the former Maritzburg United mentor is adamant that his side can benefit from the presence of a proven goalscorer."Come January, listen, any team at any given time will always be looking to complete the puzzle and as we know at Chiefs the biggest challenge has been scoring goals," he said in post-match comments."(Bernard) Parker has scored in the past two matches which gave us a bit of a reprieve, Shabba as well. [But] if we can get a consistent goalscorer, they make the difference."Compliment as well to Parker and Shabba, they did tremendously well, they had a great effect on the game," he added.Chiefs have a total of six strikes in their current squad and between them they have netted a mere three goals of the 18 goals scored in the league.
