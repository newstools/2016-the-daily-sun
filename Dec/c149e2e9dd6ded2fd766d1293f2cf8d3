MOURNERS watched in disbelief as five coffins were lowered into their graves at Mmakau Cemetery on Saturday. They all belonged to the Sebati family, who were wiped out by thugs last Tuesday.Some mourners fainted as the coffins were lowered into their graves. They wept uncontrollably as dad Constable Lucky Sebati (42), mother Manzo (40), sister Tshegofatso (22) and her stillborn baby (she was seven months pregnant at the time), as well as three-year-old brother Oatlagile were laid to rest. The family were killed by gunmen on 6 December in what is believed to have been a robbery. The incident took place in Mmakau, outside Mothutlung in North West. At the time of the ambush Onthatile was reported to have been outside getting rid of dirty water after cleaning up the kitchen. According to police the men found Onthatile outside the house at about 10pm. They had fired a shot at her but it luckily hit her on the thigh. Thinking that she was dead the thugs had then moved into the house to attack the other family members. Brits cluster commander Major-General Eunice Makgwane said what happened to the Sebati family was sad.Constable Sebati was stationed at Hebron Police Station. He also owned a mortuary and was a mashonisa. &ldquo;The people who did this are heartless. &ldquo;We have to make sure that we get these criminals and throw them in jail because if we don&rsquo;t we will have failed the family,&rdquo; said Makgwane.She said the police are hoping to make a breakthrough soon.Speaking at the funeral, Sebati&rsquo;s uncle, Peter Ratlhagane, said the family was still reeling in shock. &ldquo;This is like a dream to us. &ldquo;As the family, we are still trying to come to terms with their deaths, but it is so hard,&rdquo; he told the mourners.
