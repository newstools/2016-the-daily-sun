GA-RANKUWA residents had a blast on Saturday.This was as they launched the first of its kind, the Ga-Rankuwa Carnival.The big day started at &shy;Casandra Park and ended at the Ga-Rankuwa Stadium.The event was attended by about 370 people as part of the Ga-Rankuwa Homecoming Week. The homecoming week started on 17 December and will end on 23 December.The idea was started by comedian Itu Buchelo and his friend Dockey Tladi using their company, Rankuwa Events.Itu said he was worried by the fact that once vibrant areas such as his township were losing their vibe.He decided to come up with an idea, not only to bring life back to the kasi, but also something to bring community members together.&ldquo;I noticed that people in my township were no longer enjoying being at home during the festive season and wanted to change that. &ldquo;Our idea will make them enjoy their kasis as they used to in the good old days.&rdquo; Itu said he was impressed by the way residents responded to his idea and took part despite the fact that it was a day after the busy Reconciliation Day.He said he was encouraged by the problems and challenges in his kasi.Botshelo Montwedi (13) said she was happy that her kasi would have a carnival every year.&ldquo;My cousins will come visit every year because my kasi will now be on fire.&rdquo;
