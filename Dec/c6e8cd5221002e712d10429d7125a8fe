WHEN a seven-year-old boy came back home from playing with his friends, he found his mum&rsquo;s body on the floor. His father was allegedly sitting on the bed, staring at the body! The boy immediately ran out to the neighbour&rsquo;s house. He returned hours later. However, this time, things were different. His mum&rsquo;s body, wrapped in a blanket was still there, but his dad was now hanging from the roof rafters. This is the shocking sight that greeted residents of Newskom, near Mbombela in Mpumalanga, last Wednesday. A neighbour said earlier the couple had been heard arguing loudly.&ldquo;They were making a lot of noise and you could hear that they were fighting.&ldquo;Because they always fought, we just ignored them. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t have known that this time it would go this far.&rdquo;Police spokeswoman Captain Jabu Ndubane said when cops arrived at the scene, they found the woman&rsquo;s body had bruises. Her husband was hanging from the roof rafters. &ldquo;We suspect that the husband wrapped his wife&rsquo;s body in a blanket because he wanted to dump or hide it,&rdquo; said Ndubane. &ldquo;But he couldn&rsquo;t because his son walked in on him.&rdquo;She said inquest and murder dockets have been opened.The child has been taken to a place of safety.
