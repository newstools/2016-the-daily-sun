AT FIRST there were cries of joy as the 500 RDP recipients were given keys to their brand new homes.But as soon as Human Settlements MEC Speedy Mashilo and Mbombela mayor Sibusiso Mathonsi left the kasi, they turned to cries of fear.This was after an unidentified group of local people came and shouted at the new house owners, saying: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want people from other townships here!&rdquo; The same evening, several homeowners were forcibly removed from their RDPs, while others had their keys stolen.Door handles were also removed and the stand numbers were painted over. The disturbing scene happened on 10 December at Thekwane North extension one, outside the Mpumalanga capital, when government handed over 500 houses to those qualifying for an RDP programme. Many of the recipients are elderly residents like gogo Gejane Mbiba (82), who personally received her keys from the MEC. Gogo&rsquo;s son Andrew told Daily Sun he had been standing guard at his mother&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve received many threats,&rdquo; he said.Gogo said she had seen it all before. She was physically removed from her Mbombela RDP house in Matsulu in 2010.&ldquo;Locals forced themselves into our houses, knocking down doors and beating residents, demanding the keys,&rdquo; she said. She added that she registered a case with the department and it took five years to get a new house.Now she is facing illegal eviction yet again.Human settlements spokesman Freddy Ngobe said: &ldquo;Anyone found occupying a house they do not own as per the housing register will face the full might of the law. &ldquo;Victims of this illegal removal must immediately report it to the police.&rdquo; &ndash; AENS
