KZN ward committees were supposed to complete their elections before yesterday.And while most of them did the right thing, some failed to elect committee members. At the troubled ward 95 in Folweni, south of Durban, residents seemed sure that the elections would not take place soon.Two meetings over the past two weeks ended in chaos and protests.Residents blamed the ANC provincial leadership for ignoring their call to have Councillor Thokozani Xulu replaced, as they claimed he was sent to their area.A source said: &ldquo;We cannot move forward and leave unresolved issues behind. We appealed to the ANC to resolve this problem before the elections, but they ignored us.&rdquo; The said that the first meeting on 20 November near Golokodo Cemetery did not even begin as residents went on the rampage straight away.&ldquo;The second meeting on Sunday also did not go well. The voting officers sent by the municipality wanted to manipulate the election process by trying to choose Xulu&rsquo;s friends only. A fight broke out and the meeting was called off again,&rdquo; said the source.Supra Zuma, ANC provincial secretary, said the issue about the selection of the ward committee was being handled by municipalities. But he denied claims that Xulu was forced on residents.&ldquo;If the residents did not want him, how come he won in the elections? Besides, they know which platform to use if they want to talk to us,&rdquo; said Zuma.
