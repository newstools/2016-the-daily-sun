THE man was humiliated once when his wife admitted that their child was not his. Now he claims a tribal court has humiliated him even more! He said the chief&rsquo;s ruling that the child&rsquo;s dad must pay only two cows and two goats in damages wasn&rsquo;t enough. The 46-year-old from Ixopo, in southern KwaZulu-Natal, said he deserved at least four cows!He said his humiliation started in August when he found out that his elder son (8) was not his biological child.He took the matter to a tribal court, hoping for justice, but the ruling left him even more disappointed.The neighbour who made his wife (31) pregnant was found guilty and charged two cows and two goats as damages, which he allegedly promised to pay before April next year.&ldquo;I had to accept the inkosi&rsquo;s ruling but I am really not happy. My neighbour ruined my reputation and made me feel less of a man. &ldquo;He had his wife but chose to impregnate mine. I thought he deserved to pay more,&rdquo; sobbed the miserable man.He told Daily Sun he started having suspicions in 2008 when his wife told him that she was pregnant.&ldquo;I work in Gauteng and only come home during the holidays. Her conception date did not match the time I visited home.&rdquo;The guilty neighbour (49) refused to comment on the matter. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any reason why I have to explain my affairs to you,&rdquo; he said. Attempts to reach the man&rsquo;s wife were unsuccessful as her cellphone was on voicemail. The chief said he did not want to discuss the matter.
