She told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Prayer protected my son from his evil kidnappers.&rdquo;Nomfuneko said her son disappeared on Friday night.&ldquo;I was so scared.

Police spokesman Captain Raphael Motloung said: &ldquo;A passerby saw a man lying helplessly in a donga and alerted us. Our team rushed there and found him handcuffed, and he was rescued.
