BANYANA Banyana will be hoping to return home with a consolation prize after their last Africa Women&rsquo;s Cup of Nations match today. The senior national women&rsquo;s side takes on Ghana in the bronze medal match at the Stade Ahmadou Ahidjo in Yaound&eacute;, Cameroon, (4.30pm SA time).After a gutsy display and disappointing loss to defending champions Nigeria on Tuesday, Desiree Ellis&rsquo; charges will want to see their efforts rewarded with a medal before returning to Mzansi. After returning home empty-handed from the 2014 edition of the tournament in Namibia, taking the bronze will mean they have at least made some progress since that disappointing campaign.Banyana should display an equally gutsy performance in their match against the Black Queens today. With Ghana hosting the 2018 edition of the competition, which will also double as Fifa Women&rsquo;s World Cup qualifiers, they will want to send a message ahead of that event and not give South Africa an easy match. Ellis and her technical team should field an attacking lineup, like they did in their last group match against Egypt. With Jermaine Seoposenwe returning from suspension, she will pair well with feisty Mamelodi Sundowns Ladies&rsquo; Andisiwe Mgcoyi, supported by Durban Ladies&rsquo; Silindile Ngubane. Having Leandra Smeda playing on the wing will also help the supply of balls to the front and she is usually able to get herself into goal-scoring positions. Nothando Vilakazi, Bambanani Mbane, Noko Matlou and Lebogang Mabatle can be trusted to produce a strong defence for keeper Andile Dlamini, while captain Janine van Wyk could start from the bench. Van Wyk had given opposing strikers leeway in the South African defence in previous matches. Against the Indomitable Lionesses and Super Falcons, Linda Motlhalo and Thembi Kgatlana proved to be liabilities, not capable of using their heads when they have the ball in goal-scoring positions and ultimately losing possession.
