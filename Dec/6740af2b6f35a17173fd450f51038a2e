THE 17 taximen arrested two weeks ago on the R61 near Corana between Mthatha and Libode will spend another week in jail.They appeared in the Ngqeleni District Court on Wednesday for a formal bail application. But the case was postponed to next Friday due to confusion over the court&rsquo;s jurisdiction. The men are charged with public violence and possession of dangerous weapons. They were found in possession of firearms, bush knives, pangas and other weapons.More than 20 people have been killed in taxi violence this year. The cause of the violence is the route between the Mthatha CBD and Libode, a small town outside Mthatha. Two rival taxi associations, Border Alliance and the Uncedo Association, blame each other for the deadly clashes.Defence lawyer Xolani Pangwa said the Ngqeleni court had no authority to preside over the case because Gxulu location, where the alleged incident took place, belongs to the Libode jurisdiction. Magistrate Sikhanyiso Ngomthi said: &ldquo;We decided to postpone this case in order to clarify the issue.&rdquo;All suspects were remanded in custody.
