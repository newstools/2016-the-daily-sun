THERE are many everyday heroes on this planet.One of them is Shavarsh Karapetyan (63), who has been the world champion in fin swimming an impressive 17 times. Fin swimming is an underwater sport where fins (single or double) are used for propulsion.Shavarsh, who is Armenian, is an 11-time world record- holder.He was on his usual run around a dam in Yerevan in Armenia in September 1976 when a bus carrying 92 passengers lost control and ended up in the water. The bus immediately sank to the bottom, 10 metres underwater, and most of the passengers were unconscious due to the freezing water. Shavarsh saved the lives of 20 people. He dived down many times but not everyone he pulled out survived. After the 30th attempt he passed out. He was in a coma for 46 days with pneumonia, but lived to tell the tale.
