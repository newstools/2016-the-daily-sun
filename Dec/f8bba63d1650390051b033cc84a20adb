SEWAGE spills near the finishing point greeted the thousands taking part in the Nelson Mandela 5km Remembrance Walk.The river of kak, used pads and condoms was caused by a blocked drain at Kgosi Mampuru ll Correctional Services. The walk started at the Union Buildings in Tshwane yesterday.Advocate George Bizos, Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga, Gauteng Premier David Makhura, activist Sophie de Bruyn and some of Madiba&rsquo;s family members took part.Some walked through the kak while others ran to avoid the smell.Participant Alpheus Mogapi (44) said the situation was very disturbing. &ldquo;Our lungs bring oxygen into our bodies to provide energy and remove carbon dioxide. But in this case, we inhaled this bad smell into our bodies which could be harmful,&rdquo; he said.He said the walk was supposed to be respectful because they were honouring Nelson Mandela.Gogo Florinah Sekgaolelo (69) said she was looking forward to enjoying the walk but the bad smell ruined her day.&ldquo;It was very hot and the smell was unbearable because of the heat. I nearly threw up because of the smell.&rdquo; She said the organisers should have chosen another road for them to reach the finishing point.City of Tshwane spokesman Lindela Mashigo said the drain was reported to their offices on the day and a team sent to attend to it. &ldquo;We have sent our team to attend to the matter even though that area falls under the military and public works departments,&rdquo; he said.
