KAIZER Chiefs fans will have a spring in their step again after the club broke their winless streak of nine matches in all competitions yesterday. Amakhosi finally managed to change their fortunes when they beat Polokwane City 3-2 at the FNB Stadium. Goals by Bernard Parker, Joseph Molangoane and Willard Katsande ensured Chiefs fans left the stadium singing, while Rodney Ramagalela and Puleng Tlolane scored for City.Steve Komphela also got some welcome breathing room, as Chiefs supporters had been baying for his blood of late. Although Amakhosi supporters outnumbered Rise and Shine fans, it was the visitors who were more vocal in the early stages of the game. Visibly irate Chiefs supporters started cheering only when Brilliant Khuzwayo saved Ramagalela&rsquo;s penalty in the first half. It seems most Chiefs fans had thrown in the towel and given up on their team, as empty orange seats in the 90 000-seater venue spoke volumes.The hosts started the game on the attack but failed to get the ball in the back of George Chigova&rsquo;s net. The City keeper was kept busy for the better part of the first half, while Khuzwayo might as well have been on holiday.The Soweto giants had been in troubled waters since drawing 0-0 with neighbours Orlando Pirates at the end of October after their last league victory over Ajax Cape Town in the same month. Losses and draws followed, with Chiefs not having much luck in cup matches either. Free State Stars eliminated them in the second round of the Telkom Knockout. The win will give Komphela&rsquo;s charges some confidence ahead of their last league match of the year against Golden Arrows ON Wednesday. Arrows drew 1-1 with Premiership rookies Baroka FC in Durban yesterday, with Richard Matloga and Danny Phiri getting a goal each.
