What happened next was witnessed by Pastor Sakhiwe Maseti of St John&rsquo;s Apostolic Church. According to Maseti, Bongani ran a distance of more than 100 metres to his church. His attacker was chasing him, holding a hammer and a knife.&ldquo;I heard a man calling for help while running towards my church,&rdquo; said the pastor.&ldquo;Maybe he knew he was dying so he chose a church of all places because he wanted to die close to God the creator.&ldquo;Bongani first fell in the churchyard after the suspect attacked him. &ldquo;He then stood up and ran into the church. &ldquo;Before I could intervene, the attacker hit Bongani with a hammer and stabbed him. He died on the spot.&rdquo;Family member Ntombifikile Magiyose believes the accused planned to kill Bongani &ndash; and that&rsquo;s why he invited him for a drink.
