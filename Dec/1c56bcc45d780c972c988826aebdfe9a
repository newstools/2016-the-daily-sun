Former Umtata Bush Bucks striker and PSL top-scorer Wilfred Mugeyi feels that red-hot striker Tendai Ndoro has what it takes to reach 25-goal mark this season.The 28-year-old in-form centre-forward has hit the target 12 times in all competitions to date, which makes him the current Absa Premiership top goalscorer."Ndoro is that type of striker who has always shown that hunger for goal since his stint with Black Aces (now Cape Town City), and I'm not surprised at all with his current strike rate," Mugeyi told&nbsp;Vodacom Soccer."His hunger and never-say-die attitude is what sets him aside from other current PSL strikers at the moment."It may be too early for now to predict the number of goals Ndoro can score by the end of the season, but judging by his form and hunger he still shows in front of goals, I can put my head on the block by saying that he has what it takes to reach the 25-goal mark that has not been reached by any PSL striker in eleven seasons now."To be honest, the 35-goal mark set by Collins Mbesuma in 2004/2005 season still looks unlikely to be broken this season," admits Mugeyi, a former PSL Top Scorer with 25 goals in 1996/97 season.Apart from Collins Mbesuma's 35 goals in 2004/05 season and Pollen Ndlanya's 29 goals in 1998/99 season since the PSL's inception in 1996/97 season, Daniel Mudau and Mabhuti Khenyeza (23), Daniel Mudau and Lesley Manyathela (21), Knowledge Musona and Siyabonga Nomvete (20), are the only other players to have broken the 20-goal mark.Ndoro's goalscoring record since making his PSL debut with Mpumalanga Black Aces to date: 7 goals in 17 starts -2013/14 season; 7 goals in 26 starts and 3 substitutions - 2014/15 season (Mpumalanga Black Aces); 10 goals in 16 starts and 6 substitutions - 2015/16 season (Orlando Pirates); 12 goals in all competitions in 15 starts in 2016/17 season.Ndoro is expected to continue where he has left off, when Bucs resume their Premiership campaign against Maritzburg United on Tuesday at Harry Gwala Stadium.
