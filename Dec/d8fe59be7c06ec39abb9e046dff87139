FOR 10 long years she begged Eskom for power! But Eskom paid no attention to Lulu Mkhonto.So the woman (38) from Tonga, near Malelane in Mpumalanga, claimed she had to become an inyoka.Lulu&rsquo;s home is one of 22 houses which were overlooked by the power utility when they connected households in the area. They don&rsquo;t even know why they were skipped.&ldquo;I have been calling and emailing Eskom all these years, begging them to connect us as well. But they completely ignore us,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;Eskom officials are going around villages with the media, exposing izinyoka. &ldquo;But we feel it&rsquo;s time to expose them for failing to provide us with legal electricity!&rdquo;Lulu said she and her neighbours want to pay for the electricity they use, as legal power is safer. Lulu&rsquo;s neighbour Promise Khoza (39) said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfair to listen to Eskom representatives encouraging people to pay for electricity while we&rsquo;re begging them to connect us legally. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been making a nuisance of ourselves at their offices, but they still won&rsquo;t help.&rdquo; Eskom spokesman Eric Khoza promised to respond after Daily Sun sent him an inquiry, but no response was received by the time of going to print. He did not answer follow-up telephone calls either.But SunPower may have worked its magic! Because after the Daily Sun inquiry, Eskom officials contacted Lulu and went to assess the situation. They promised to sort out the problem by the end of January.
