Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Lucky Baloyi is confident Amakhosi can "turn it around", ahead of their clash with high-flying Polokwane City at FNB Stadium.Steve Komphela's side are hoping to return to the winning trail following a string of disappointing results that has left them seven points off the pace set by league leaders Cape Town City, albeit with a game in hand on Eric Tinkler's men.A win against Rise and Shine on Sunday would ease the pressure on Komphela and his players, while also potentially lifting them as high as fourth place in the Absa Premiership standings.In an interview with the club's official website, Baloyi said: "Yes, we can turn it around."If you take a look at our last performance against Chippa United and the one against Bloemfontein Celtic, there was a huge improvement."It's all about us as players to keep on pushing and remembering whom we are playing for (Kaizer Chiefs supporters)."He added: "The best way to come out of this (slump) and to improve is for us all to stick together and play ourselves out of this situation."It's going to take a collective effort from us all to start winning again and that will start with our match this Sunday against Polokwane City."
