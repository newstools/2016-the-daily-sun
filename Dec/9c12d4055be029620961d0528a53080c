ZOLANI Sibeko will hear on Monday if he is going to get bail. Sibeko (35), one of the accused in the murder and kidnapping case of Jayde Panayiotou, has applied for bail in the Eastern Cape High Court in Port Elizabeth. Advocate Peter Daubermann said the prosecution had called many witnesses but not a single piece of evidence emerged against Sibeko in the eight weeks of the trial.Daubermann said the applicant undertakes to stand trial and will not interfere with witnesses or tamper with evidence. He has no previous convictions or pending cases and this is his first attempt at bail.Daubermann said the State has no case against Sibeko and he will be acquitted as tracker data does not place him at the scene of the crime. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t rely on Thereza Botha, who assisted the police to arrest the applicant. She is a data analyst, not a cellphone expert.&ldquo;The fact that Sibeko&rsquo;s cellphone connects to the Linton Grange tower on 15 and 16 April 2015 means nothing,&rdquo; said Daubermann.The prosecution claims Sibeko went with the alleged hitman to Jayde&rsquo;s home and the home of her friend, Cherise Swanepoel, on those nights last year.The State claims Jayde&rsquo;s husband, Christopher, ordered her kidnapping and murder.State prosecutor Advocate Marius Stander asked the court to deny Sibeko bail.
