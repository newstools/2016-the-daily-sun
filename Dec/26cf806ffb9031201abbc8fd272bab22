WHEN Itumeleng Kilamore woke up one morning last week, he found a squirrel in his yard.The surprised young man decided to chase the uninvited guest away, but instead the squirrel &ndash; hardly bigger than a rat &ndash; charged him!The 29-year-old tried to run away but the squirrel was hot on his heels! He ran out of his yard, screaming for help from neighbours.When his neighbours arrived, the animal entered Itumeleng&rsquo;s shack to hide but they cornered it and killed it, and then burned it.Itumeleng from Fochville between Joburg and Potchefstroom, told Daily Sun he now lives in fear.He said he suspected the animal had been sent by unknown rivals as his tavern attracted many customers, especially over weekends.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m well known and my customers prefer my tavern because it&rsquo;s vibey. Maybe this is making my rivals jealous.&rdquo; Itumeleng said he feared what would happen next as the squirrel was burnt in his yard.&ldquo;But I believe my ancestors will protect me against any evil.&rdquo; Neighbour Potso Kiewet said they were surprised because the animal jumped many houses but chose Itumeleng&rsquo;s.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still a shock. We live far from the bush, so you don&rsquo;t expect to see wild animals here.&rdquo; Itumeleng added that he kept his yard clean to avoid attracting unwanted animals.Sangoma Mothoetsho Lerole said jealous people could use many things to send harm to a person.&ldquo;I suggest Itumeleng consults a sangoma who will throw the bones to see who sent the creature.&rdquo; SPCA inspector, Andrew Kekana, said killing such animals is acrime.&ldquo;We condemn such actions. Animals are protected under the Animal Protection Act. &ldquo;We educate people about such cruelty of animals in our outreach programmes. Animals cannot be part of witchcraft as people think,&rdquo; he added.
