FOLLOWING the serious allegations against Tolly Mashamaite, the ANC Youth League in Limpopo has made serious calls to its members to be faithful to their partners. The league&rsquo;s Limpopo spokesman, Matome Moremi, said especially those in leadership positions, must have principles to save the movement&rsquo;s good name. The league&rsquo;s call comes after rape and bribery charges were dropped because of a lack of evidence involving Waterberg regional secretary Tolly Mashamaite on Monday.Mashamaite was accused of raping a 23-year-old woman in a hotel in Mokopane in April but the evidence did not convince the court. Moremi said there are lessons to be learned from the case.&ldquo;We must not tolerate anyone who falsely accuses our people of such heinous acts.&rdquo;He said those who conspired against Mashamaite must be brought to book.He further warned members in the Waterberg to focus on branch general meetings to prepare for their regional congress. He said the anarchy which was displayed in the provincial offices and regional offices in the name of the regional secretary will not be tolerated. &ldquo;The youth league notes the verdict against the Waterberg regional secretary. The league is on record in its previous pronouncement that Comrade Tolly is presumed innocent until proven guilty by the court.&rdquo;Mashamaite, who is now receiving public sympathy, said his case must be used as a lesson for men to be faithful to their wives. He said he was framed by members of the party from the region and from the province. Spokesman for the ANC in Limpopo, Aluwani Netshianda, said the provincial executive committee will decide about Mashamaite&rsquo;s position shortly in light of the recent court development.
