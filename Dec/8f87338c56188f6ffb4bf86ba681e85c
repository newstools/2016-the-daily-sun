ST PETER&rsquo;S Catholic Church held a series of prayer services between Friday and Sunday against the evil deeds that befell the church in the past few weeks.The trouble started after Father Nthutang Modise was rotated and replaced by another pastor. Angry people came at night, burned the holy tabernacle, pulled down photos of the bishop and even the pope, and pumped five bullets into the altar!The unknown attackers broke into the church in Jouberton, near Klerksdorp about two weeks ago.Daily Sun saw a letter to the parish from Bishop Victor Phalana calling on everyone to pray that those responsible be exposed and arrested. The letter also urged church members to co-operate with the police. &ldquo;Let us respect the parish. It is not a museum. It is a place of worship. There is desecration and a crime has been committed. Do not go out of empty curiosity but with the aim of prayer and reparation,&rdquo; the letter read.The bishop told Daily Sun: &ldquo;They attacked the blessed sacrament. For us this is sacrilege and blasphemy.&rdquo;North West police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said church representatives went to the cop shop but no case was opened.
