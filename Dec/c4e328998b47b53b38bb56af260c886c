HEAVILY armed cops and agents of the Central Intelligence Organisation have thwarted a possible revolt during Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s state of the nation address.The heavy deployment of security personnel came amid speculation of mass protests by the pressure group, Tajamuka, literally meaning, &ldquo;The nation has revolted.&rdquo;Riot police guarded all roads and strategic points leading to the parliament in Harare while intelligence operatives were on standby.The Africa Unity Square, an open park where people normally enjoy their lunch hour or engage in prayer, was a hive of uniformed and plain clothes cops.They were there to ensure that movement around public places in the capital was minimised.Tajamuka spokesman, Promise Mkwananzi, told media that Mugabe and his government had dismally failed the nation, hence the mass action.&ldquo;We wanted to force government to pay civil servants their salaries and bonuses before Christmas.&ldquo;They are afraid because they know they have failed and let the people down,&rdquo; he said.Patson Dzamara, brother of kidnapped journalist-cum-activist, Itai, of the Occupy Africa Unity Square movement, said security operatives&rsquo; reaction was a sign of fear.&ldquo;They are doing everything in their power to protect the misrule and oppression. They are afraid of the people they purportedly lead,&rdquo; said Dzamara.Last week, riot police crushed a peaceful protest as angry Zimbabweans demonstrated against the introduction of so-called bond notes by the broke government. &ndash; CAJ NEWS
