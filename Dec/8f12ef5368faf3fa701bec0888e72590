KAIZER CHIEFS are in trouble!&nbsp; And fans are baying for head coach Steve Komphela&rsquo;s blood!&nbsp; THE TEAM HAVE BEEN ON A LONG LOSING STREAK THIS YEAR.&nbsp; After months of giving the team second chances, supporters are finally gatvol.&nbsp; Following Saturday&rsquo;s humiliating loss to Chippa United, fans pelted Komphela with bottles and other rubbish! The situation turned ugly at Port Elizabeth&rsquo;s Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium after Amakhosi were beaten 3-1 by the struggling Chippa United in an Absa Premiership match.It wasn&rsquo;t the first time supporters have vented their anger on Komphela, a former Bafana Bafana skipper. Last month, they were furious after the team&rsquo;s 1-1 draw against SuperSport United at FNB Stadium. More and more supporters have been calling for Komphela to resign as the team has gone eight games without a win. However, club spokesman Vina Maphosa told Daily Sun there had been no discussion about replacing the coach. &ldquo;The problem we have at the club is that the results are not coming our way. &ldquo;This will be reviewed when club officials meet to review the match.&rdquo; He said although the club understood that supporters were frustrated, they didn&rsquo;t condone throwing bottles on to the field. &ldquo;Supporters are part of Kaizer Chiefs and we hear their plea. &ldquo;However, we cannot just jump and respond to what they ask without reviewing and looking into the problems the club faces.&rdquo; Maphosa said supporters expected Chiefs to win every game they played. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a problem when we don&rsquo;t win and we review it,&rdquo; he said.Out of the seven games the team has played without winning, three were losses and four were draws. The last time Chiefs won a game was in October when they beat Ajax Cape Town 2-0 in a Premier Soccer League match at Durban&rsquo;s Moses Mabhida Stadium. Steve Komphela took over as coach from Stuart Baxter last June. Baxter, who became coach in 2012, had a successful tenure with the Soweto giants, winning two league and cup double triumphs in his three seasons. Following Saturday&rsquo;s disastrous match, Komphela was quoted as saying: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing I can do about it.&rdquo; Komphela was also quoted as saying in his post-match interview that he would accept the defeat and take it on his shoulders. &ldquo;As they always say, victory has many fathers but a loss is an orphan.&rdquo;
