SFISO Ncwane&rsquo;s sister, Gugu, did not get to pour soil in her brother&rsquo;s grave!Now Gugu feels as if she didn&rsquo;t get a chance to say her final goodbye.By the time Gugu arrived at the graveyard, people were leaving the cemetery and Sfiso&rsquo;s tombstone had already been unveiled. Gugu claim the mix-up occurred when they left Moses Mabhida Stadium. Gugu, her uncle and other relatives had not been sitting with the family at the stadium. According to Gugu, only certain people were allowed to sit with Sfiso&rsquo;s widow, Ayanda. Unfortunately for Gugu, she was not one of them. So they left ahead to wait for the funeral procession at Chesterville&rsquo;s Heroes Acre, just outside Durban. What the family and many other fans did not know was that Sfiso&rsquo;s final resting place had been changed to Lala Kahle cemetery in Hillcrest. Gugu said: &ldquo;All along we thought our brother would be buried at Heroes Acre. &ldquo;So we went there, but when we arrived at the cemetery, we heard on the radio that things had been changed. &ldquo;We rushed to Lala Kahle but when we arrived the pastor had already finished with the service. People were already leaving the cemetery. &ldquo;Sfiso&rsquo;s tombstone had already been unveiled. I can&rsquo;t explain the feeling I had at that time. Sfiso is my brother, after all. The fact that I couldn&rsquo;t even throw soil into his grave has opened a big hole in my heart,&rdquo; said Gugu.She said there were many other people waiting at Heroes Acre, singing her brother&rsquo;s songs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they were just as disappointed as we were.&rdquo;
