SuperSport United central midfielder Cole Alexander wants Matsatsantsa to keep showing the same appetite and desire that has taken the club to second in the standings.United face Bloemfontein Celtic in a Premiership encounter in the Free State this weekend. Siwelele are 12th in the table with two wins and three draws in nine matches.Stuart Baxter's outfit are on a good run of form after having recorded eight wins and five draws in their last 13 matches in all competitions.In addition, the Pretoria-based outfit have also kept eight clean sheets and notably thrashed Orlando Pirates 6-1. Nonetheless, Alexander, who returned recently from injury, has made it clear he expects more of the same.He told the club's official website: "I feel great to be back and I'm looking forward to help the team to win matches. Our trip to Mpumalanga was successful. We are hoping to keep the same mentality going forward."Meanwhile, Jeremy Brockie and Bradley Grobler could be doubtful for the trip due to injuries they picked up in the semi-final victory over Bucs. Sunday's action gets underway from 15:30 at Dr. Petrus Molemela Stadium in Bloemfontein.
