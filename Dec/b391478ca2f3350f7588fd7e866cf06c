THE iron councillor is a woman of her word!Councillor Zaza Raikane, who stood firm and told an initiation indaba on Sunday all initiation schools in the Vaal would be shut down, has delivered on her word!Raikane, who is the MMC for health in Sedibeng has been in the news for enforcing a ban on all initiation schools in the Vaal this summer.The ban was first recommended by the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities after deadly gang violence in the Vaal.But some initiation practitioners decided to defy the ban. They went ahead and set up camp in the bushes.Sending a clear message about the ban, cops and municipal officials have raided initiation camps for girls set up around the Vaal too.The raids started on Tuesday and continued until early on Wednesday morning.Following a successful operation led by Raikane and her team, 84 initiates were rescued from several initiation camps.Raikane emphasised she did not initiate the ban on initiation schools, but was only using the municipality&rsquo;s bylaws to carry out the recommendations of the commission.&ldquo;We cannot stand by and watch as gangsters take control of our lives,&rdquo; she said.After they were rescued from the schools, the initiates were taken to a rescue centre in Daleside, Midvaal.From there, they were taken to the Vaal Teknorama municipal museum in Vereeniging by bus, where their parents were waiting for them.Constable Khabo Raselomane said initiates who were not collected by their parents would be kept at a place of safety until their parents came forward.
