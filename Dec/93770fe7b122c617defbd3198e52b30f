FOR 16 years, Gladys Madwara&rsquo;s family couldn&rsquo;t afford to put a proper tombstone on her dead father&rsquo;s grave.But eventually Gladys&rsquo; son, who works at a vehicle company, managed to save R18 000 and made it possible for the family to erect the tombstone.However, the family&rsquo;s joy didn&rsquo;t last long. Thugs stole the headstone pillars a few days after the stone was installed at Bucwa Cemetery in KwaNobuhle, Uitenhage in the Eastern Cape. Only the base was left.Gladys (54) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;When my son finally saved enough money to buy a tombstone for my dad, we held a ceremony on Reconciliation Day to thank him for everything he did for us while he was still alive.&rdquo;She said they were shocked when they arrived at the cemetery on Christmas Day to find the tombstone had been stolen.&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what to do. I cried bitterly and couldn&rsquo;t be consoled. I don&rsquo;t think my son will be able to save enough again to replace it,&rdquo; said Gladys. She said she has since learnt from other families that her father&rsquo;s grave was one of many that was robbed.&ldquo;The thugs usually steal the base of the tombstone. I&rsquo;m really hurt by this. &ldquo;God should punish them. Our ancestors should also teach these thugs a lesson. These people don&rsquo;t respect the cemetery.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t suspect anyone. This was the work of evil thugs who are just robbing the dead,&rdquo; Gladys said.Police spokeswoman Lieutenant Gerda Swarts said no case had been opened.&ldquo;We encourage residents to report people who violate loved ones&rsquo; graves to the police,&rdquo; Swarts told Daily Sun.
