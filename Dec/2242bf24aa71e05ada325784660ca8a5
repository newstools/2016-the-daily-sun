ON FRIDAY, 17 taxi drivers accused of inciting violence learned that they will spend Christmas behind bars. The group said to be linked to the Uncedo Taxi Association was arrested on the R61 outside Mthatha, Eastern Cape, three weeks ago for allegedly attacking drivers and taxis belonging to the rival Border Taxi Organisation. The Ngqeleni Magistrates Court denied bail to the suspects, who are facing charges of public violence, possession of dangerous weapons and assault. Prosecutor Michael Bradfield said taxi violence was a serious crime and asked the court to act strongly to protect innocent people who depended on taxis for travel. He said since the arrest of the suspects three weeks ago, there had been no new incidents of taxi violence in the area. The case was postponed until 17 January.
