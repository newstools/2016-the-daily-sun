WHILE cops are dealing with the issue of drinking and driving on the roads, lifeguards at KZN beaches are battling cases of drinking and swimming!And it is a fight that lifeguards and police sources claim they seem to be losing. According to a source, KZN beaches require as much attention as the roads, as alcohol abuse at the seaside seems to be on the rise.&ldquo;People drinking alcohol at beaches try to swim and find themselves experiencing difficulties in the water.&ldquo;While some are lucky to be rescued in time, others do not make it. &ldquo;Most drowning incidents happen as a result of intoxication,&rdquo; said a cop patrolling Durban&rsquo;s South Beach. The cop said Dakota Beach lagoon in Isipingo is the worst.A lifeguard said law enforcement agencies need to be harsher with visitors to the beach who do not obey the rules. &ldquo;Their stubbornness claims lives. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a problem working at an overcrowded beach. &ldquo;But our job becomes very difficult when crowds are drunk and refuse to follow the rules,&rdquo; said a lifeguard.Yesterday, two incidents of drowning were reported. Netcare 911 spokesman Chris Botha said in the first incident, a man (51) was pulled from the river mouth at Dakota Beach lagoon.&ldquo;Allegedly, the man had been swimming when he experienced difficulties and disappeared beneath the water. &ldquo;Attempts were made to resuscitate him but he died,&rdquo; said Botha.In the second incident, a 30-year-old man drowned while surfing at Umkomaas Beach.Botha said neither of the two drownings was linked to drunkenness.Provincial police have warned against swimming while under the influence of alcohol as it can have deadly consequences. &ldquo;Alcohol affects one&rsquo;s judgement and causes extreme tiredness in the water,&rdquo; read their statement.KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said two inquest dockets have been opened.&ldquo;Circumstances surrounding the incidents are still being investigated.&rdquo;
