DONKEYS are known to be stubborn, but this one is a beast of another kind.It packs a nasty bite and has already attacked three kids, sending two to hospital.Residents say they have had enough of the donkey from hell, and that the beast&rsquo;s owner doesn&rsquo;t seem to care.The donkey is terrorising residents of Mooilande, near Three Rivers in the Vaal. Residents said they now feared for the safety of their young ones after the donkey attacked three kids, aged three, five and 11, on three different occasions. The most recent attack happened on Saturday.Speaking to Daily Sun, Lindiwe Nqabashe, the mother of a three-year-old, said she&rsquo;s grateful her daughter is still alive after the donkey picked her up, threw her to the ground and stepped on her.&ldquo;My daughter almost died. I still can&rsquo;t believe a donkey did that,&rdquo; she said.One of the kids now has an infected wound after she was bitten by the donkey. According to the parents, the owner has refused to do anything about the animal, despite the attacks.&ldquo;He told us we should press charges against the donkey and see if it will appear in court,&rdquo; Lindiwe told the People&rsquo;s Paper.The owner of the donkey refused to comment on the matter. Vereeniging police spokesman Captain Fikile Funda urged the parents to open a case with police. &ldquo;The owner of the donkey will be charged with negligently allowing an animal to cause injury. &ldquo;This falls under Section 42 of the Animal Amendment Act of 1993.&ldquo;The investigating officer will talk to the local SPCA branch to see how they can assist, as cops do not have authority to remove animals.&rdquo;
