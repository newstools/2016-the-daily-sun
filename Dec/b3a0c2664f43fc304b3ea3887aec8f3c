RELIGIOUS leaders in Nelson Mandela Bay vowed that the prophets of Doom and snakes would not be allowed to set foot there. They say that spraying people with Doom and feeding them snakes is the work of the devil.Bishop Samuel Williams of the Believers Apostolic Ministries Episcopal slammed these prophets.He said: &ldquo;This is the work of the devil to discredit the work of God and to destroy the churches of God.&ldquo;We cannot allow that to happen in our region. As holy men we have to stand firm and oppose this evil practice. Healing people with Doom, snakes and other methods is not written in the holy scriptures, and if it isn&rsquo;t written, it comes from the devil.&ldquo;The Bible says there was the word and the word was with God and the word became God. Also the Bible teaches us to heal the sick with faith and using the word of God. Doom is dangerous and was not made to heal people but to kill cockroaches and other insects.&ldquo;In Matthew 34 the Bible warns us against these fake prophets.&rdquo;He was supported by Bishop Sandile Jika, president of the Interdominational Ministerial Association of South Africa, who said: &ldquo;The work of these prophets is not in line with God and they aren&rsquo;t welcome in our society.&ldquo;What theology do they use? Where did they learn these outrageous methods? Surely this isn&rsquo;t the work of God, but the work of the devil? Doom and snakes can&rsquo;t be used to heal sick people. The Bible teaches us to place our hands over sick people and speak the word of God.&rdquo;
