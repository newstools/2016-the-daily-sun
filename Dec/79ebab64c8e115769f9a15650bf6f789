WHEN her neighbour was killed this year, Latticia Monedi took it upon herself to raise his kids.The 60-year-old from Meadowlands in Soweto said they were used to her. Their mum was nowhere to be seen and Latticia said before he died, her neighbour didn&rsquo;t even want to talk about their mother. Latticia said she did everything possible to become their official guardian after they were placed in an orphanage. &ldquo;The children begged me, crying, &lsquo;Gogo, we want to live with you&rsquo;.&rdquo; Latticia said she was granted permission to be the children&rsquo;s guardian. But now, she is unable to take care of the three aged 18, 17 and eight, as Sassa is sending her from pillar to post. She said she was told to come with their mum. &ldquo;I grew up with their father and helped him to take care of the kids. He was killed this year, leaving them without anyone to look after them.&ldquo;He was a single father and no one knew who the mum was. He said she abandoned her kids for booze.&rdquo; Daily Sun contacted Sassa spokeswoman Nandi Mosai, who promised to contact Latticia. She said as long as she has proof of adoption or guardianship, she should be able to receive the grant. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look into it. The money is granted to the primary caregiver. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be the parent.&rdquo;
