&ldquo;I&rsquo;LL never get the kind of money I make here washing someone&rsquo;s clothes as a domestic worker.&rdquo; These were the words of a 33-year-old who would only give her name as Nomsa. She grinds rocks containing gold in Matholesville, Joburg. She told Daily Sun she had been able to buy four cows back home in Zimbabwe with the money she made working for illegal miners. However, it came at a cost as she recently lost her zama zama husband during an illegal mining operation. Nomsa spoke to the SunTeam during a City of Joburg campaign to educate illegal miners about the negative effect their work has on the community&rsquo;s water supply. When officials from Home Affairs and other government departments arrived in the area, which has about 3 000 people working at illegal mining, some residents tried to run away but they returned when they realised they weren&rsquo;t being arrested. Most of the women who were grinding rocks did so while carrying their babies on their backs. A Zimbabwean who said his name was Masombule said he had been mining illegally for five years. &ldquo;Hunger is what brought us here. It&rsquo;s bad in our country. We don&rsquo;t like what we are doing.&rdquo; Officials from the City of Joburg said the reservoir in Roodepoort, which supplies water to Matholesville and Tshepisong, was running dry because of the extra pressure being put on the supply by illegal mining. This has led to taps running dry for the past few days.
