FOR 20 years, the wall has separated their yards. But on Saturday, a bitter battle between the neighbours ended in the wall being demolished and five people being arrested for malicious damage to property! The war between the neighbours in Drieziek extension 1 in Orange Farm, Joburg has divided the entire kasi. According to Emily Molefe (54), it all started in October when she spoke out about her neighbours&rsquo; child and his friends allegedly smoking dagga outside her gate. She said ever since that day, her family and the neighbours have been at each other&rsquo;s throats.&ldquo;We were peaceful neighbours for more than 20 years.&ldquo;But the boy from next door started swearing at me in front of neighbours after I complained about his dagga smoking. I then decided to take out a protection order against my neighbours. But this only made things worse. &ldquo;They then started complaining about my wall being on their land, even though it had been there for 20 years.&rdquo; Emily said when she returned from a funeral on Saturday, she found the wall demolished. &ldquo;Neighbours showed me photos of the boy next door and his family destroying my wall. &ldquo;My son was alone in the house and couldn&rsquo;t stop them. &ldquo;I went to the police early the next morning and when I returned home with the cops, I found the neighbours breaking down the part of the wall attached to my outside toilet,&rdquo; she claimed. Emily said all she wanted was for her neighbours to rebuild the wall they broke down. The neighbours were arrested and taken to Orange Farm Police Station. Police spokesman Captain Keke Motsiri said five suspects appeared in court on Monday on a charge of malicious damage to property.
