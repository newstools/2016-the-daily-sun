A VERBAL sparring session has added spice to the clash between two South African boxing champions, International Boxing Organisation champion Gideon &ldquo;Hardcore&rdquo; Buthelezi and the World Boxing Federation&rsquo;s Doctor &ldquo;The Silent Assassin&rdquo; Ntsele ahead of their grudge rematch.The talented fighters will square off in an eight-round non-title bout at Orient Theatre tomorrow in a tournament promoted by Ayanda Matiti&rsquo;s Xaba Promotions and Events. If the verbal sparring is anything to go by, the contest is set to produce fireworks.Both warriors are anticipating a titanic battle in their second meeting. Buthelezi won the first instalment a year ago, capturing the World Boxing Association Pan African super flyweight crown that was at stake. However, the Free State born Ntsele believes his opponent will not repeat the same feat he achieved in their first encounter. &ldquo;My preparation has been going well, I&rsquo;m in sensational shape and Buthelezi should not expect an easy ride this time. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mentally and physically fit for our contest. With our previous fight I was not 100% ready, as I had a lot on my mind,&rdquo; Ntsele said.&ldquo;I also had a minor injury which cost me dearly and we had contractual issues with the promoter over the purse building up to the bout.&ldquo;This time there has been no hiccups during my preparation and I&rsquo;m anticipating a tough contest,&rdquo; said Ntsele.The southpaw from Boipatong warned, however, that if his opponent had not improved his boxing skills he would get a hiding again.Said Buthelezi: &ldquo;If he is still the same boxer I met a year ago, he will be punished. He does not pose much of a threat because in our last encounter I was cruising.&rdquo; The 30-year-old former World Boxing Organisation Africa champion has registered 17 victories and five defeats, while his Bloemfontein based opponent has won 20 fights, with eight defeats and a draw. They both come off three straight wins.
