SAMSON Ngunyi is hiding in his house. For a month now, the 53-year-old has been telling his kids to say he&rsquo;s not at home if people come looking for him. When he goes to the toilet, he peeps through the window to check if anyone sees him. Samson&rsquo;s not crazy or sick . . . he just owes money to almost everyone he knows in the village of Refilwe near Cullinan, east of Tshwane. According to Samson, his troubles started in August when he fell ill for two months. He took sick leave from his job as a meter reader for the City of Tshwane. Then he went back to work with a doctor&rsquo;s letter confirming he was sick. &ldquo;I gave my employers the doctor&rsquo;s letter but they didn&rsquo;t pay me, and they didn&rsquo;t tell me why.&rdquo; To survive, he said he had to borrow money from friends, family and mashonisas in Refilwe. &ldquo;I borrowed money from everyone, but a month went past and my salary still wasn&rsquo;t paid,&rdquo; said Samson. &ldquo;This is the reason I have gone into hiding in my own home. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of telling all the people that I owe that I will pay them next month &ndash; but at the end of the month I still have no money.&rdquo; On top of this, Samson now fears that mashonisas might hurt him. &ldquo;My friends and relatives are understanding but mashonisas are very stubborn. When they want their money, you pay or you face big trouble,&rdquo; he said. City of Tshwane spokesman Lindela Mashigo said the matter has been referred to human resources to determine why Samson was not paid.
