WHEN thugs snatched Mebby Sipopo&rsquo;s cellphone from her handbag while she was on her way home one day, she bought another phone and moved on with her life. But today, three years later, the phone has come back to haunt her! Two men, claiming to be cops, stormed her house on Sunday, claiming the phone was being used to send threatening WhatsApp messages.The person who received the messages had allegedly laid charges with the police.Mebby, of Balmoral near Witbank in Mpumalanga, said: &ldquo;Two mlungus in private clothes kicked down my door and demanded that I give them the guns I threatened to use to kill someone.&rdquo;&ldquo;They said I had been sending this person messages on WhatsApp. They showed me the messages. They even showed me pictures of guns I allegedly threatened to use.&rdquo;Mebby said she explained to the cops that she lost the phone three years ago, and was no longer using the number. But the cops still demanded to search her house for guns and bullets, and then confronted Mebby&rsquo;s grandfather, Rekel Brukwe (66).He said one of the cops demanded that he tell them where the guns were hidden.&ldquo;I told them we don&rsquo;t have guns here. He pulled up his shirt and showed me the gun on his waist and said if I didn&rsquo;t talk, I would get a bullet. &ldquo;They searched every room in the house and found nothing. Then left.&rdquo; Mebby said she then went to the police station. Sergeant Gerald Sedibe confirmed that a case of malicious damage to property was opened. &ldquo;We are also investigating the possibility that someone might have impersonated police officers,&rdquo; he said.
