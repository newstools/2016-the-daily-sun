THE EFF will pay the Guptas&rsquo; legal costs &ndash; if they can get hold of a bill!&ldquo;The court has spoken and we can&rsquo;t fight it. We have been waiting for the tax bill,&rdquo; party secretary-general Godrich Gardee told The People&rsquo;s Paper yesterday.This follows reports that the Guptas had obtained a warrant to seize property worth about R180 000 from the EFF&rsquo;s head office in Joburg.News24 reported that, according to an order granted to the Guptas by the North Gauteng High Court, the sheriff&rsquo;s office in Joburg has been instructed to seize goods at the EFF&rsquo;s Braamfontein headquarters.This is to cover the Guptas&rsquo; legal costs relating to an earlier court battle with EFF leader Julius Malema and the party.In February, High Court Judge Willem Louw granted an interdict in favour of the Guptas and their companies against Malema and the EFF. He ordered the EFF, Malema and Gauteng spokesman Ntobeng Ntobeng to stop threatening the Gupta brothers, companies and workers.The EFF was also ordered to pay the Guptas&rsquo; legal costs totalling over R140 000.The EFF also owes the Guptas another R38 000 after an unsuccessful attempt by the party to appeal Louw&rsquo;s decision.Gardee said they had no problem settling the debt but must be served with an invoice. &ldquo;I only saw the attachment e-mailed to me by the media. I haven&rsquo;t seen any person here to present the bill. &ldquo;If they come and produce proof that we owe them, we will pay them,&rdquo; he told Daily Sun.
