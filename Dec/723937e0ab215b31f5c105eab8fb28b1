The new state-of-the-art children&rsquo;s hospital built in memory of former president Nelson Mandela is proof that South Africa is on a good path, former Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke said yesterday.Speaking at the launch of the Nelson Mandela Children's Hospital, Moseneke &ndash; who is one of the executors of Mandela&rsquo;s estate &ndash; told a full tent that, although South Africa was going through a "bad patch", this was&nbsp;a characteristic of many revolutionary countries."True revolutions are never linear. They meander; they curve then go in different directions," he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a great country; we are going through a wobble&hellip; When you have a long journey and you have a bad patch, you buckle up and continue with the journey."He said the country&rsquo;s struggles were larger than "one leader&rsquo;s term of office".&nbsp;"We need men and women of courage and vision. This hospital is a reminder to all of us that there is a place for hard work, for excellence, for honesty, for doing good things, for giving and not taking," he said.Moseneke was speaking at the hospital&rsquo;s launch in Parktown, north of Johannesburg, on Friday morning.The hospital is only one of four specialised children&rsquo;s hospitals on the continent, and only one of two in the country.Specialised paediatric careConstruction on the R1bn healthcare facility began in April 2014. It consists of 200 beds and will be a referral based hospital. However, the hospital has pledged not to turn away any child who is in need of care.The hospital will also be a centre for specialised paediatric care for nurses and doctors in the region. Having worked closely with Mandela for several years, Moseneke told the crowd that if the struggle stalwart had been present at the event, he would have said "Ndiyabulela&nbsp;(I thank you)".Moseneke, who is also the University of Witwatersrand's chancellor, said the institution had contributed immensely by making available the land on which the hospital was built.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/new-childrens-hospital-is-proof-that-sa-is-on-a-good-path-moseneke-20161202Wits Vice Chancellor Adam Habib responded, saying the institution wanted to help fulfil "the dreams of one of humanity&rsquo;s greatest sons".
