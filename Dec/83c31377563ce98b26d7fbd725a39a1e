A VILLAGE has honoured the memory of a murdered teenager with the help of a non-profit organisation.Residents of Drayini Village near Dutywa are part of a team that is building a double-storey creche in honour of Lutho Qudalele (19).Lutho, a mother of two, was kidnapped, raped and killed on Women&rsquo;s Day in 2014. She had gone to a creche run by her mum to fetch sugar when Luthando Qwele (31) kidnapped her. Her body was found 13 days later in a nearby river. In February, her kidnapper was handed three life sentences by the Mthatha High Court. The new multi-facility day care centre is being built next to the mud creche where Lutho was last seen alive.Following her painful death, her friend contacted the Samarpan Foundation, a non-profit organisation based in India, and shared Lutho&rsquo;s story.The foundation visited the village and donated the money needed to build the creche. The foundation uses waste plastic bottles filled with wet soil as bricks.This unusual construction method has created employment for poverty stricken villagers who collect the bottles and bring them to construction sites. Nicola Irvine, a volunteer, offered to run the project after working with the foundation in India for years.She said the response from the community had been overwhelmingly positive. Once construction is completed, the creche will have three classrooms and house a total of 80 kids. A rondavel built by the women in the village will be used to run empowerment projects.Masakhane Qudalele, Lutho&rsquo;s father, said: &ldquo;Lutho was kind to everyone. On several occasions, she had given food to the man who eventually killed her. &ldquo;Her kindness will forever live through this creche.&rdquo;
