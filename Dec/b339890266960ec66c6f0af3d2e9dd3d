SENIOR police officers are being used as a scapegoat to protect those behind the Marikana massacre.This is according to Joseph Mathunjwa, leader of the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union.&ldquo;We are very concerned the government wants to find an easy target in the form of senior police officers,&rdquo; he said on Tuesday.&ldquo;No one at any police department can just order mineworkers to be killed. Something like that had to be well thought out.&rdquo;Mathunjwa was speaking at a media briefing just days after President Jacob Zuma released an update on steps being taken to implement the Farlam Commission of Inquiry&rsquo;s recommendations. Some of the officers involved in the tragedy will face numerous charges, including murder, attempted murder and the obstruction of justice. &ndash; NEWS24
