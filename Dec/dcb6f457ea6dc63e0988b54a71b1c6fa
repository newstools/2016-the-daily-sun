GAMBIAN President Yahya Jammeh continues to insist he won't step down despite losing the 1 December election, as West African leaders and Western powers urged him to hand over power peacefully.Jammeh initially conceded defeat on state television after 22 years in power, but a week later reversed his position, denouncing the election results and demanding a new vote.Last week, Gambian troops took over the Independent Electoral Commission office in the capital, Banjur, and instructed its chairman to leave while barring other employees from entering.Jammeh's pledge to stay was broadcast on state television yesterday and indicated a hardening of the veteran president's position. It came a day after president-elect Adama Barrow said he was ready to take office on 18 January - the day Jammeh's mandate ends.Jammeh also condemned West Africa's regional organisation for what he termed "meddling" in The Gambia's affairs.The political crisis in The Gambia will be settled internally and peacefully, Jammeh said, adding he would maintain his position of challenging the election result.A spokesman for the opposition coalition that backed president-elect has given assurances that Jammeh will not face prosecution on leaving office.Jammeh's government has been accused of detaining, torturing and killing opponents.He came to power in 1994 as a 29-year-old army officer following a military coup and has won four previous polls.&nbsp;http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/12/defiant-gambian-president-refuses-step-161221051821514.html
