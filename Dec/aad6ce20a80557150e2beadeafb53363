JOSEPH Thongo says a river rescued him from cruel thugs!&nbsp; He was able to jump into the water after being attacked and this saved his life.&nbsp; Joseph (18) said he was walking down the street in Emaphupheni, Ekurhuleni on Sunday afternoon when two thugs in a VW City Golf approached him. They allegedly forced him into the car, took him to Barcelona kasi and started beating him.&nbsp; &ldquo;When they realised there were witnesses, they forced me into the car again and drove to the bush,&rdquo; said Joseph.&nbsp; &ldquo;I pleaded with them to leave me alone, but they kept quiet. One of them closed my mouth so I couldn&rsquo;t scream.&rdquo;&nbsp; While he was being beaten, Joseph saw a river nearby.&nbsp; &ldquo;I dived into the water and started swimming without looking back.&rdquo;&nbsp; Joseph said when he turned his head, he couldn&rsquo;t see the thugs. Etwatwa police spokesman Captain Pheello Mothapo said: &ldquo;We can confirm a suspect has been arrested. He will appear in court soon.&rdquo;&nbsp;
