SHOCKING things were found during Operation Vala at Losperfontein Prison near Brits, North West yesterday. They included dagga, TVs, music systems, kettles, cellphones, sharp objects, electrical extensions, a four pound hammer, a device to break windows and lots of homemade booze. The clean-up operation was conducted by 54 prison officials from Limpopo, Mpumalanga and North West. Authorities say they don&rsquo;t know how these items got into the prison. But according to acting regional commissioner Kenneth Mthombeni, they are smuggled in by prisoners, prison officials and families of those serving time in jail.Prisoners allegedly use plastic lotion containers to hide cellphones, and washing power to hide dagga brought in from the outside.The booze was thrown down the drain, while the other items were taken to the dump. One of the prisoners even had a winning Lotto ticket for R7 000. How he manage to play Lotto will be investigated. Most prisoners refused to sign consent forms to be interviewed because, according to authorities, they were angry their stuff was taken. Mthombeni said many prisoners plan to escape or commit other crimes during this time of the year.&ldquo;This is an unfamiliar place and we did it deliberately to bring you here so you can see that ours is a thankless job,&rdquo; Mthombeni told the media. &ldquo;We want you to see that we are doing this to make the place safer.&rdquo; Operation Vala started at 5am and lasted until the afternoon. An inmate (36) said he was happy with the raid, as it means they will now feel safer in prison.
