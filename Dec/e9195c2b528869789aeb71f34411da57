A PENSIONER living with a disability has finally become a proud home owner after living on a farm for more than four decades. Selina Ngoma (72), a former resident of Randfontein in Rand West Municipality, got her first house from the Gauteng Human Settlements Department and Standard Bank last week as part of the 16 days of activism for no violence against women and children campaign. Gogo Selina said before going to the old age home more than two years ago, she lived on a farm in the Randfontein area. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very excited to get this beautiful house. When my son picked me up to go to the house I didn&rsquo;t believe it was true until I saw it. &ldquo;I cannot wait to move into my new house, which I will share with my daughter, Francine Molefane and her three children.&rdquo; The gogo received one of 10 houses built by the department in partnership with the banking group and Mogale City Municipality. Keith Khoza of the human settlements department said: &ldquo;We thank the bank for taking on the challenge of changing the lives of families.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a life-changing Christmas present.&rdquo;
