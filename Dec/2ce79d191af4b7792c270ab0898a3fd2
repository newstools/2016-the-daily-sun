WITH the festive season at its peak, the malls are filled with shoppers having a good time.But thugs are also roaming the malls, hoping to make a fast buck. One unlucky victim from KwaMashu, north of Durban, was robbed and hijacked at Bridge City Shopping Centre and then dumped at a cemetery &ndash; by fong kong cops! It happened on Tuesday. Police said the man was in his car at the centre when two suspects approached him. They told him they were cops and that his vehicle was involved in a shooting incident at M section, KwaMashu and he had to go with them to the cop shop. They got into the man&rsquo;s car and drove with him to Molweni Cemetery, where they took his car and cash and dumped him. KZN cops have since warned residents to be wary of fake cops.Captain Nqobile Gwala said if you are suspicious of someone presenting himself as a cop, you should not hesitate to contact the nearest police station. &ldquo;Residents have the right to request police members&rsquo; employment cards before allowing anyone inside their vehicle or premises.&rdquo; She said a case of carjacking was opened at KwaMashu Police Station. Gwala said in another incident, a 36-year-old man who had withdrawn cash from a bank at the mall on Saturday was confronted by five suspects as he was walking out. &ldquo;One produced a firearm and tried to rob the victim before shooting him in the stomach. The suspects then fled from the scene.&rdquo; A gun was found not far away. &ldquo;The man was taken to hospital for treatment. Charges of armed robbery and attempted murder were opened at KwaMashu Police Station for investigation.&rdquo;
