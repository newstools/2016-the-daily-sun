THE three women who are best friends were sitting in the yard enjoying umqombhothi together on Sunday afternoon. When their booze was finished and it was the 71-year-old gogo&rsquo;s turn to pay, she took out R20 which she gave to Lena Leeuw (62) from Namibia kasi, Mangaung to go and buy more. But when Lena came back, gogo changed her mind and said she did not want to booze with them anymore. She allegedly took out the knife from between her breasts and stabbed her two friends. When the cops arrived, the drunk gogo tried to escape by crawling away but she was caught. Lena was discharged after being stitched. Sara Olifant is still in hospital with stab wounds. Lena told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We are best friends. We have always enjoyed drinking African beer together. On Sunday gogo joined me and Sara at my house and we continued our usual daily routine of drinking together. When our booze was finished, she sent me get a refill. I did not suspect anything bad could happen.&rdquo;Lena said she went into the house to get an empty container to pour the booze into.&ldquo;I went into the house to get the container we use to pour the drinks with. But when I came back the gogo pulled out a knife and stabbed me in my left breast.&rdquo; Sara screamed and asked her why was she was stabbing her.&ldquo;She said she was not going to let us drink away her money. When the cops arrived, she tried to crawl away but I pulled her back. I was lucky that she did not stab me in the heart. Sara was admitted to the trauma unit in hospital,&rdquo; said Lena. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi confirmed the stabbing and said the suspect was arrested and charged with assault. She will appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court soon.
