HIS victims called him Satan. But now he is in jail, sentenced to 632 years.And the man who helped to put him behind bars is detective constable Moraka Pale from Olifantsfontein Police Station. He told Daily Sun that Jahen Luphahla (29), along with his friends, were kidnapping people coming to Joburg at the Zimbabwe border post in Limpopo.&ldquo;They would take them from Limpopo as if they were giving them a lift. Along the way, he would claim the car had broken down and he needed assistance and start demanding money from the people in the car,&rdquo; said Pale.On Monday last week the court gave Satan and his two co-accused heavy sentences. He said Phathimuzi Sibanda (28), nicknamed KK, was given eight sentences totalling 632 years in jail. Madida Sicelo (31), nicknamed Madam, was given two life sentences with 692 years in jail and Jahen Luphahla (29), nicknamed Satan, received seven life sentences with 632 years in jail.He said the three suspects were involved in serious crimes including rape, murder and assault.&ldquo;When I was interviewing surviving victims and witnesses I was shocked to find out what the suspects were doing to their victims. &ldquo;Some were raped in front of other people who were also prisoners at a house in Rabie Ridge near Tembisa.&rdquo;He said other victims were burned alive and dumped in the bush.Pale thanked his superiors and his colleagues for the support he was given during the investigation.&ldquo;It was a collective effort,&rdquo; he said.He said he often worked extra hours to go to Limpopo to get information and evidence to trace and arrest the suspects.
