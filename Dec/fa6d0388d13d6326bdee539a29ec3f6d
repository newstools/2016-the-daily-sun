DROUGHT is forcing Mozambican girls out of school and into forced marriages.School drop-outs in vulnerable provinces exceed 10% largely due to the drought, as families move to seek alternative livelihood incomes.Increasing food prices leave households with fewer resources, often leaving no money for school-related expenses.Drop-out rates are high among lower income groups amid competition between children&rsquo;s time for study and the need to engage in food and income generating activities. Many girls are now missing out on continuing their education because they are forced to walk long distances to fetch water and find food.Worryingly, a premature end to school is associated with the prevalence of child marriage and exposure to rape.One out of two girls are married before 18 and 14% are already married by the age of 15. &ndash; CAJ NEWS
