WHEN Ernest Mabula&rsquo;s wife died last weekend, his heart was broken. But now things have gone from bad to worse! Neighbours have accused him of killing his wife and threatened to necklace him! The 66-year-old from Alexandra, north of Joburg, told Daily Sun his wife Julia Malelekani died of natural causes after a long illness.&ldquo;My neighbours knew my wife had been in and out of hospital. &ldquo;After her death, they came to me and said I killed her and they would kill me as revenge. &ldquo;I tried to show them the post mortem results, which show there were no injuries on her body and that she died naturally. But they keep on saying they will take me to a special court and burn me with petrol.&rdquo;Ernest said he loved his wife and there was no way he would have killed her. &ldquo;We were both sangomas and we used to share ideas on how to mix herbs. We were a loyal couple and we were always helping each other.&ldquo;But now I can&rsquo;t sit on the mattress with her family or help prepare for her funeral on Wednesday,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have left home and I&rsquo;m living with friends while I mourn. &ldquo;She was everything to me and instead of helping me deal with my loss, people are treating me like a dangerous criminal.&rdquo; Julia&rsquo;s sister Lettie Mthethwa (51) confirmed her sister died of natural causes. &ldquo;We knew she was sick and she was in and out of the hospital. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know why residents think Ernest killed our sister. It&rsquo;s not true. &ldquo;He would never do something like that.&rdquo;
