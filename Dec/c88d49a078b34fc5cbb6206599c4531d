MAMPHO&rsquo;s ex was used to hitting her and getting away with it. This time, however, luck was not on his side. The community decided to take matters into their own hands. This was after the ex-boyfriend hit Mampho Mlelekoa (22) from Vila Lisa near Vosloorus in Ekurhuleni on Saturday with a glass and ran away.According to Mampho, the man arrived at her house the next day to find community members waiting for him. The community beat the man to a pulp. She said he is in hospital where he is alleged to be fighting for his life. Mampho said she met the man at the beginning of the year.She said they moved in together shortly afterwards. &ldquo;He has been abusive since we met. Two months ago I decided I couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore and told him it was over between us. I decided to move out.&rdquo; Mampho said the man didn&rsquo;t want to accept it. &ldquo;When I was with him he stopped me from talking to other people in the neighbourhood. He even tried to stop me from talking to my parents. &ldquo;He used to threaten that even if I were to report him to the police he would pray for the officers and they&rsquo;d leave him alone. He would tell me that prayer is stronger than cops.&rdquo; Mampho said she had bumped into him on Saturday and he had demanded she go to his place with him. &ldquo;I refused! That is when he hit me with a glass and ran away.&rdquo; Constable Nkimeleng Mabula, Dawn Park police spokeswoman, said a case of assault was opened.
