&ldquo;STOP telling lies or else . . .&rdquo;This is a warning to former Generations actor Mandla Hlatshwayo. Mandla, who works as a DJ at a local radio station, posted on his Facebook account that on Wednesday a regular customer at the popular Ditsaleng Pub in Soweto was allegedly denied access. However, pub owner Ketse Mbatha has denied the allegation. Instead she warned Mandla to tell the truth or face a possible lawsuit. According to Ketse, a man named Bujo has been a regular customer since the pub opened last month. She said: &ldquo;We know Bujo as our customer. He has always come and enjoyed his weekends at the pub.&ldquo;On Saturday there was a performance by Alaska and we had a certain dress code for the event. &ldquo;The security guard at the gate told him that he was not dressed appropriately.&rdquo; Ketse said on his way out, Bujo met Mandla and told him that he was going home to dress for the occasion. &ldquo;Mandla decided to post wrong information on his Facebook page.&ldquo;He posted false allegations against Ditsaleng claiming that a regular patron, Bujo was unfairly denied access to the venue due to discrimination,&rdquo; said Ketse.Ketse is demanding that Mandla apologise to him via email. He must also retract his post on all social media platforms.However, Mandla is not apologetic and said it is his Facebook wall. He said he can write whatever he likes. &ldquo;They can go ahead and sue me for all I care. Bujo is very close to me and it was hurtful to hear he had been kicked out. &ldquo;He was clean. If they wanted him to dress according to their dress code they should have given him the clothes,&rdquo; said a defiant Mandla. However, the man at the centre of the storm said he was eventually allowed back in. He said: &ldquo;I changed my clothes and went back. I was let in and the party continued. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell Mandla to post anything. I can&rsquo;t control what he posts. He is a grown man and has his own opinion,&rdquo; said Bujo.
