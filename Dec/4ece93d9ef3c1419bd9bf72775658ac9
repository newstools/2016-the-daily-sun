MARKING 100 days in office, Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba said he had inherited a city that is even more corrupt than he thought. &ldquo;Corruption is not a strong enough term for what was taking place in the City of Joburg. &ldquo;It was shameless looting,&rdquo; said Mashaba.He was speaking in Fordsburg, Joburg, yesterday, where he outlined the problems his administration has faced since taking over.&ldquo;We have inherited a development plan where millions of rands are committed to useless projects,&rdquo; said the mayor.Mashaba said his administration is putting together an investigation unit to deal with corruption. The unit will be headed by former Gauteng Hawks boss Shadrack Sibiya.&ldquo;All wrongdoers must be exposed and sent to jail,&rdquo; said the mayor. He said some corrupt officials were having sleepless nights after hearing of the investigation. Mashaba said the party has visited and spoken to many embassies about citizens who entered the country illegally. &ldquo;Anyone who is in our city illegally must prepare to face the music. We want to create a city where citizens are able to live in peace and enjoy their lives. &ldquo;We will not sit around and watch Joburg being hijacked by criminals.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll use all the resources available to me to find these criminals. &ldquo;Some people may think we are heartless, but that is not true. We just want a crime-free city.&rdquo;
