THE Limpopo High Court sitting in Thohoyandou yesterday dismissed the Vhavenda kingship dispute. Masindi Mphephu had gone to court, claiming she should have been given the crown over her uncle, Toni, but she was overlooked because she is a woman. The 24-year-old Masindi wanted to interdict the coronation of her uncle. Toni was supposed to be crowned by President Jacob Zuma in September. But it couldn&rsquo;t happen as Masindi challenged the president&rsquo;s decision to recognise her uncle as king.King Toni Mphephu was recognised by the president in 2012. Masindi is the only legitimate child of former King Khosikhulu, who was killed in a car crash in 1997. At the time, Masindi was only six years old. Supporters of Toni, including senior traditional leaders, family and friends attended court in their numbers. There were also a few people supporting Masindi. The case, which was scheduled for three days, was dismissed by Judge Ephraim Makgoba, who ordered both parties to pay their own legal costs. Makgoba didn&rsquo;t give reasons for dismissing the case, saying he would do so later. He said the Vhavenda nation needed to know who would be their leader as soon as possible. &ldquo;I am now making an order that this case be dismissed, and that each party will bear its own legal costs,&rdquo; he said.
