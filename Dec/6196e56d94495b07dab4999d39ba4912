SFISO Ncwane&rsquo;s fans are expected to flock to Durban and Joburg today and tomorrow for his memorial services. However, his mum&rsquo;s family have said they won&rsquo;t be attending either service, as they are planning their own in Malangeni, southern KZN. Sfiso&rsquo;s mum, Fikile, told Daily Sun the memorial service would only be for family and neighbours. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware of the services in Joburg and Durban but unfortunately, we won&rsquo;t be attending. The biggest challenge is that these memorial services are far from our homes. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have transport to get there.&rdquo; Fikile said Sfiso&rsquo;s wife, Ayanda, had a house in Joburg, where she was mourning. She said the family last spoke to Ayanda on Tuesday when she told them about the funeral arrangements. Sfiso&rsquo;s sister, Gugu, said Ayanda planned to take his body to Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban for the funeral on Saturday without stopping at the family home. This is despite the fact that according to tradition, a body needs to start its journey to the funeral at home. Gugu acknowledged this was the traditional practice, but said the family would follow Ayanda&rsquo;s instructions. She said she was grateful for the support the family had been getting. &ldquo;Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa has been very supportive. Many artists and other people have also been there for us,&rdquo; she said. Family spokesman Sipho Makhabane said Sfiso would have a state funeral. Today&rsquo;s memorial service will be held at the eThekwini Community Church in Durban and the second one tomorrow will be at Grace Bible Church in Soweto.Sfiso&rsquo;s funeral service will be held at Moses Mabhida Stadium and he will be buried at Heroes Acre in Chesterville.
