EVERY KASI DJ knows not to end a set without playing the monster hit, Ska Bhora Moreki.&nbsp; But when Themba Dlamini performed two weeks ago, he forgot this golden rule.&nbsp; NOW THE 20-YEAR-OLD IS MISSING. . . AND NO ONE KNOWS IF HE&rsquo;S DEAD OR ALIVE!&nbsp; The trouble started when Themba told the crowd at a bash at a park in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, that he wouldn&rsquo;t be playing the popular song by King Monada.&nbsp; This angered drunk party-goers and they started attacking him. Themba has not been home since the violent incident and now his family fears the worst.&nbsp; According to witnesses, the crowd demanded that Themba, who is well known as a DJ in kasis around Ekurhuleni, play the song before the end of his set.&nbsp; However, he refused, saying he had run out of time.&nbsp; Most of the people at the bash had been knocking back drinks and many were very drunk.&nbsp; According to a witness, people started attacking the DJ and he ended up running for his life.&nbsp; &ldquo;They threw bottles at him and some started swearing at him after he said he was leaving. He had no choice but to run away as people were trying to chase him. &ldquo;That was the last time I saw him,&rdquo; said a witness who is Themba&rsquo;s friend.&nbsp; The friend said he believed Themba might have gone into hiding.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s still scared of the people who tried to beat him for not playing their song.&nbsp; &ldquo;The problem is his phone was stolen by thugs in a separate incident as he was coming home from a gig.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are worried because we haven&rsquo;t seen him in a long time now.&rdquo; Themba&rsquo;s grandfather, John Dlamini (61), with whom he has been living for more than five years, said he was very worried.&nbsp; &ldquo;When he didn&rsquo;t come home that night, I knew something was wrong. The boy always slept at home, no matter how late he was working.&nbsp; &ldquo;The other problem is that he was mugged and beaten a week before his disappearance.&nbsp; &ldquo;During that incident his phone was taken.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is just pure bad luck for my grandson. We had to spend Christmas without him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anybody who knows where he is must please contact us so we can be reunited.&rdquo;&nbsp; A missing person&rsquo;s case has been opened with the police.&nbsp; Etwatwa police spokesman, Captain Pheello Mothapo, confirmed the case.&nbsp; &ldquo;Police are still looking for the person reported missing to us and investigations are proceeding.&rdquo;&nbsp;
