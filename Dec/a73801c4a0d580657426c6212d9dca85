TEMBINKOSI Maxhangasana (46) claims his ex-girlfriend has locked his 4-5 and he is pleading with her to give it back to him.Some years ago, Tembinkosi and his girlfriend at the time had a fight, and after that his 4-5 allegedly started acting strangely and did not want to do the job.&ldquo;When she left she took everything that belonged to me and I didn&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said the desperate man from Alexandra, Gauteng. &ldquo;Whatever happened in the past I forgive her. I just need her to unlock my 4-5 so that I can live freely like other men.&rdquo;Tembinkosi said all he wants is to meet with his ex-lover so she can unlock his 4-5.&ldquo;She was the only woman I was sleeping with and the last person I shared a bed with.&ldquo;But in 2003 we started fighting and she opened a case of assault, housebreaking and rape against me. &ldquo;How could I have done that in my own home? She then got me arrested.&ldquo;I served 10 years at four different prisons for things I didn&rsquo;t do. She just wanted me to suffer. &ldquo;She should have just let me go. When I came back she was gone. She took all my things and my 4-5 wasn&rsquo;t working,&rdquo; Tembinkosi said.&ldquo;I thought it was the prison that affected my 4-5, but it is still not working after four years since I have been released from jail. I have even consulted traditional healers about my problem, but with no luck. &ldquo;My ex-lover, please come and talk to me so that I can have my 4-5 back.&rdquo;Mahlinza Dlamini, a traditional healer from Vosloorus in Ekurhuleni, said Tembinkosi&rsquo;s ex-girlfriend could have done something to harm his 4-5. &ldquo;It seems muthi was used on his underwear so that he couldn&rsquo;t have sex with anyone.&ldquo;He needs to find his missing clothes, including his underwear, with the help of a powerful inyanga. He will be given a choice to reverse the curse or just be healed,&rdquo; said Mahlinza.
