Following the unfortunate incidents that occurred in Polokwane on Saturday, 12 November 2016, after the match between Bafana Bafana and Senegal, SAFA placed Mashaba on suspension pending a disciplinary hearing. &nbsp; The hearing took place over five days in December 2016 (5th &ndash; 7th, 9th, 12th) and was chaired by an independent legal expert who is an Advocate of the High Court. &nbsp; Following extensive deliberations, the Chairman of the hearing concluded that the Coach was guilty of the three charges levelled against him: &nbsp; 1. Gross Misconduct/Professional Misconduct2. Gross Insubordination/Professional Misconduct3. Violation of the SAFA Communications Policy &nbsp; &ldquo;It is regrettable that we had to face the events of the past month at a time when the National Team is experiencing a resurgence in its quest to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup&rdquo; said SAFA CEO, Dennis Mumble. &nbsp; &ldquo;Due to the seriousness of the Coach&rsquo;s actions, we had to release our Head Coach with immediate effect. We shall immediately institute a search for a new Head Coach familiar with African football competition who will be expected to continue the quest to qualify for the world&rsquo;s apex football competition. We ask all supporters to continue to support Bafana Bafana,&rdquo; the SAFA CEO continued. &nbsp; The Association will urgently consult its internal structures for the purpose of finding a replacement as soon as possible.
