THE gogo died in a house that she had left to her daughter. Monica Otcheson (55) thought the house in Ekurhuleni was in her name, but she had a nasty surprise after the funeral. &ldquo;A grandchild from hell kicked us out &ndash; and now she&rsquo;s living there with her boyfriend!&rdquo; Monica told Daily Sun. She accused the 35-year-old family member of fraud. Angry Monica said: &ldquo;In 2012 my mother signed over the title deed of our family house in Brakpan to me. &ldquo;I was the beneficiary and my mother made me responsible for the house, which was supposed to be an inheritance for the whole family. &ldquo;But when she died in July last year, we were shocked to hear the title deed had changed ownership. My late mother&rsquo;s grandchild was the new owner!&rdquo; According to Monica, the ownership changed on 17 March last year.&ldquo;At the time my sister&rsquo;s child was living with her gogo and taking care of her. We discovered that she changed the title deed while my late mother was very ill. She used her gogo&rsquo;s fingerprints to sign the house into her name. Now she won&rsquo;t even let us into the yard. She always locks the house and tells us it belongs to her &ndash; so there&rsquo;s nothing we can do to change that,&rdquo; said Monica. Daily Sun contacted the granddaughter, who said the matter is being handled by her lawyer. Human settlements spokesman Mogomotsi Mogodiri said the Otcheson family needs to come to the department and lodge a complaint. &ldquo;They need to present all the documents from the original title deed holder, and show that she was indeed extremely sick during the change of ownership. The matter will be referred to a tribunal where title deeds can be contested,&rdquo; he said.
