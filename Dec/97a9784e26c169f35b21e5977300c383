A Gauteng traffic officer will spend Christmas behind bars after he was arrested for soliciting a R200 bribe, the Road Traffic Management Corporation said on Saturday. &nbsp; Spokesperson Simon Zwane said the 33-year-old man, employed by Gauteng Provincial Government, was arrested by the National Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit on the N12. He and three other officers were conducting a speed operation on the highway. &nbsp; &ldquo;The officer allegedly stopped and solicited a R200 bribe from an undercover anti-corruption officer,&rdquo; Zwane confirmed. The suspect is expected to appear in the Springs Magistrate&rsquo;s Court on Wednesday.&ldquo;The Road Traffic Management Corporation has declared war on corruption in the traffic law enforcement fraternity.
