MTHATHA shoppers got a surprise visit from the province&rsquo;s top cop yesterday.Provincial commissioner Major-General Liziwe Ntshinga took the festive season safety campaign to BT Ngebs and Circus Triangle malls.The aim of her visit was to raise public awareness about crime prevention and to strengthen ties between cops and the communities they serve.At BT Ngebs Mall, she addressed businessmen before heading to the nearby taxi rank where she met with taxi drivers. &ldquo;Since Mthatha is generally regarded as the major crime hub, we decided to come here to encourage the police to work together with communities to ensure that your festive season is a safe one. People use taxis every day. We told taxi drivers not to abuse passengers,&rdquo; she said, adding that feuding taxi associations, Uncedo and Border, should iron out their differences for the sake of the commuters.Taxi driver Litha Mayisela said: &ldquo;I welcome the increase in police visibility in the area. Hopefully, they will protect us from being attacked by members of the rival association.&rdquo;BT Ngebs operations manager Akhona Sigwela said minor crimes like shoplifting are their biggest problem.The top cop is expected to visit Aliwal North, Port Elizabeth and East London next week.
