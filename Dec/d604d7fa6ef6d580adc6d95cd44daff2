LUNGILE Qwabe wants the eight orphaned and abandoned kids in her care to worry about only one thing &ndash; their schoolwork. She makes sure she stretches every rand she gets from her own children&rsquo;s grants to cover all the kids&rsquo; needs. The 33-year-old from Esibayeni, near Komatipoort in Mpumalanga, takes care of five orphaned kids and her own three children. &ldquo;All the girls are orphans. &ldquo;The boys&rsquo; mum died two years ago and they have never met their father. I took them in because if I don&rsquo;t take care of them, who will?&rdquo; she said. Lungile, who has been battling cervical cancer for two years, said her own struggle was nothing compared to what the kids have gone through.&ldquo;Their situation opens the door to so-called blessers, who bring nothing but exploitation and Aids,&rdquo; she said. Lungile said she uses her children&rsquo;s grants to buy mealie- meal, rice, beans and vegetables. Lungile&rsquo;s neighbour said God sent her to take care of the kids. The neighbour said they were really struggling before Lungile took them under her wing. &ldquo;Lungile and the children&rsquo;s struggle is real and they need help. Many girls are raped and exploited in this area and it&rsquo;s good that she&rsquo;s protecting them.&rdquo; Amelia Nkuna (10), one of the orphans in Lungile&rsquo;s care, said what they need most is food, shoes and school uniforms. &ldquo;We wish we could have shoes and new uniforms, but mama Lungile cannot afford to buy everything for us.&ldquo;When my mum died, she didn&rsquo;t have an ID, so we don&rsquo;t have birth certificates and we can&rsquo;t apply for grants.&rdquo; Mpumalanga social development spokesman, Ronnie Masilela, said they commend Lungile&rsquo;s work, but want her to visit their local office to help her more. &ldquo;We strongly advise Lungile to immediately visit our office and see one of our social workers, who will guide her further.&rdquo;
