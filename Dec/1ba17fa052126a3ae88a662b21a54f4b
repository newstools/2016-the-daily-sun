THE alleged thug failed to break into one house when the occupants raised the alarm, but soon found another target.&nbsp; Sleeping occupants didn&rsquo;t notice him breaking in, and he soon scared them out of bed and held them hostage.&nbsp; But when he first started destroying furniture and then attempted to rape one of the women, cries sounded and the community descended on the evil suspect.&nbsp; He was lucky to survive the beating after angry residents stripped him naked and moered him.&nbsp; The incident happened in Boitumelo in the Vaal on Saturday.&nbsp; A witness told Daily Sun the suspect broke into the house in the early hours, allegedly with the intention to rape the women he found in the house.&nbsp; &ldquo;The family suspected a break-in but didn&rsquo;t react to it,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Moments later the suspect was in their house, waking everyone up and holding them hostage.&nbsp; &ldquo;He allegedly started to break stuff in the house, and when he attempted to rape one of the women, they screamed and neighbours rushed over.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was caught, stripped naked and moered by a group of angry community members,&rdquo; said the witness.&nbsp; Other witnesses at the scene said the suspect was later taken to hospital by his family who arrived at the scene.&nbsp; Police spokesman Captain Keke Motsiri said no case had been opened at Sebokeng Police Station.&nbsp; &ldquo;But the people who took the law into their own hands might face charges themselves.&nbsp; &ldquo;We always urge people at public meetings not to take the law into their own hands,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Members of the community should not beat up suspects.&nbsp; &ldquo;They should rather call the police to come and make arrests.&nbsp; &ldquo;When they take the law into their own hands, they are the ones who suffer the consequences.&rdquo;&nbsp;
