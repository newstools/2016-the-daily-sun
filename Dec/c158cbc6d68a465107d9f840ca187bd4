POLICE officers are known for enforcing law and maintaining peace in society. That is why they are highly respected. But those stationed at Ngwavuma Police Station in northern KZN are dubbed &ldquo;toy cops&rdquo; and are allegedly no longer respected by the locals.The condition of the police station is not as dignified as it is supposed to be. They are allegedly forced to attend to residents from the back of their vehicles during the rainy days.The building is is so rundown that the roof is seriously leaking and the walls are crumbling.Cops at the station said that on numerous occasions the local youth pass by to laugh at them.&ldquo;They call us names and make it clear that none of the youngsters in the village wanted to be cops and suffer like we do,&rdquo; said a cop.The station, which is said to be over 50 years old, consists of four rooms made up of stone walls and rusty corrugated iron sheets.&ldquo;In 2012, the suspended KZN police commissioner Lieutenant-General Mmamonnye Ngobeni came here and said plans were in place to build us a new facility.&rdquo;A resident, Philani Makhaye (44), who is part of the community safety structure, said: &ldquo;This is a disgrace to us because other stations like Manguzi and Hluhluwe in our neighbourhood have been renovated.&rdquo; Brigadier Jay Naicker, KZN police spokesman, said the station was third on the priority list for repairs and renovations. &ldquo;However, because the station is a heritage site, a new building will have to be constructed to meet the needs of the station. Commencement of this project is unknown at this stage as funding will be determined through a national priority list.&rdquo;Naicker continued that repairs to the roof are expected to be executed under the day to day maintenance budget. He said they&rsquo;d liaise with the station commander.
