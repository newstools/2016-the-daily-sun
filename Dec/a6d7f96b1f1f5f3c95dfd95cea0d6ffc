THE defence team of Christopher Panayiotou, the man accused of planning his wife Jayde&rsquo;s murder, brought an application before the Port Elizabeth High Court yesterday.The defence wants to consult with alleged middleman Luthando Siyoni, his girlfriend Babalwa Breakfast and Panayiotou&rsquo;s girlfriend, Chanelle Coutts.The defence also wants to consult with Donovan Vosloo, an IT expert who admitted to wiping off information from Coutts&rsquo; and Panayiotou&rsquo;s phones after Jayde&rsquo;s death.The legal team also wants to consult with Panayiotou&rsquo;s accountant, Wilma van de Bergh, to obtain information from his account relating to the R80 000 he allegedly used to pay the hitmen.Advocate Terry Price said Coutts&rsquo; evidence is crucial. &ldquo;We will hear from her how witnesses were threatened. &ldquo;We also need to consult with Siyoni and Breakfast to hear how they were treated. Breakfast was arrested unlawfully. That proves the State bullied a witness,&rdquo; he said. Judge Dayalin Chetty dismissed Price&rsquo;s application. The trial will resume on 19 April until 5 May, and 12 June until 30 June.
