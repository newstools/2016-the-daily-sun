WHILE some are preparing to celebrate the festive season, these residents face only hardship.This comes after a fire ripped though their shacks in the Kenville area of Durban yesterday. The shocked residents of 30 households could only watch as the angry flames ate all their belongings, leaving them with only the clothes they wore.Residents told Daily Sun the fire broke out in one of the shacks but that they didn&rsquo;t know what could have caused it.Tusokwakhe Mthethwa (49) said he was having a bath when he suddenly heard people shouting that there was a fire.&ldquo;I jumped out and dressed in this T-shirt and pants before I could escape. I couldn&rsquo;t even look for my shoes or important documents as the flames kept growing.&rdquo;He said he stood helplessly and watched his spaza shop and shack go up in flames.Another resident, Xolisile Mginqi (37), said she had been out job hunting when she saw flames coming from the shacks.&ldquo;The only thing I was worried about was my six-year-old child. I had left her with another woman inside the house,&rdquo; she said.Luckily her child was safe, but she also lost everything in her shack.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;m going to start. I&rsquo;m unemployed and my daughter does not have food and clothes. &ldquo;This is really bad for me. I don&rsquo;t know where we&rsquo;re going to sleep tonight. This is a sign of a bleak Christmas for me and my child,&rdquo; said Xolisile. Ward Councillor Maharaj Ashok said: &ldquo;I will contact disaster management and also get a tent that the people can use for now.&ldquo;Clothing will also be organised. They lost everything.&rdquo;He confirmed that the cause of the fire was unknown and that there were no injuries.
