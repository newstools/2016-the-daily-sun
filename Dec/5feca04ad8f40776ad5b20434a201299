PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma has gone to court to have the State Capture Report set aside. Zuma filed an affidavit in the North Gauteng High Court to challenge former public protector Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s remedial action. In particular, Zuma wants the court to set aside Madonsela&rsquo;s instruction for him to set up a judicial commission of inquiry to probe state capture. The report found evidence suggesting that Zuma had improper dealings with the Gupta family. Zuma&rsquo;s application referred to Madonsela&rsquo;s instruction for the commission to be set up within 30 days, and for a judge chosen by the chief justice of the Constitutional Court to head it. The application argues that if Zuma followed Madonsela&rsquo;s instructions, he would just be rubber stamping what she wanted, which would be improper in terms of section 7(3)(b)(i) of the Public Protector Act. &ldquo;There is no matter of public interest that I would require advice on by the appointment of a commission of inquiry,&rdquo; the application reads. Zuma also argues that Madonsela is trying to dictate to him how he should do his job.The application says that the remedial action suggested violates the separation of powers.
