LEHLOHONOLO Seema is finding it tough in the Bloemfontein Celtic coaching hot seat.Seema told the media after he guided his charges to a surprise 2-1 win over his former club, Orlando Pirates, in an Absa Premiership match at Orlando Stadium on Tuesday that he was not yet ready to be in charge permanently.Seema and John Maduka have now won two games, drawn three times and lost twice since they replaced Serame Letsoaka on a caretaker basis in November.Celtic have eased their relegation worries as they are now in 12th position with 15 points from 14 games. Said Seema: &ldquo;If this is the trauma I will have to go through, I am unsure (if I would want to continue), because it&rsquo;s not easy. Celtic are not looking to appoint me and John (Maduka) as permanent coaches. You saw in the media that they are looking for another coach. As long as the results are coming they don&rsquo;t have the pressure to take just anybody available. I help them get the man they want.&rdquo;Seema revealed he was ready to downgrade to his previous position and take charge of Celtic&rsquo;s MultiChoice Diski Challenge side again. &ldquo;I am not even thinking of staying on until the end of the season. Tomorrow you might find out that there is a new coach &ndash; changes could happen during the festive break. &ldquo;I have prepared programmes for the players for the break. I will do pre-season with them if we&rsquo;re still in charge. &ldquo;I enjoy working with our Diski Challenge team and am involved with many things. I wouldn&rsquo;t feel hard done by if they get another coach. I still want to go back to class and obtain my Uefa B and A Licence. So I am not in a rush to be the head coach of Celtic. &ldquo;If they find a new coach I will be happy and whenever I am called on to help out, I will still be available.&rdquo;
