CONVICTED murderer Patrick Wisani angered the family and relatives of a woman he killed when he smiled at them in court yesterday.&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that, Patrick. You killed our child and now you are laughing at us. Don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; shouted the angry relatives.They shouted at him, telling him he must go to jail, where he belongs. The 31-year-old former ANC Youth League leader appeared in the South Gauteng High Court sitting in Randburg, north of Joburg for sentencing. The matter was postponed to April to give his new lawyer an opportunity to familiarise himself with the case.Wisani was found guilty of murdering his 24-year-old girlfriend Nosipho Mandleleni. He beat her to death with a sjambok at their home in Yeoville, Joburg, in September last year. Judge Mohamed Ismail agreed to a request for the lengthy postponement but warned Wisani he would not tolerate delay tactics. &ldquo;The firm that instructed you seems to want a prolonged trial. I have been doing this for many years . . . do not use the transcript of the record as an excuse.&rdquo;
