Sixteen years after getting her RDP house, Elsie Dopholo, 75, still lives in a leaking two-roomed shack built next to it.Dopholo, 75, of Unifound location in Queenstown, Eastern Cape, has refused to move into the house because the walls are cracked and the roof leaks.She says she has been begging the Lukhanje local municipality to fix it since it was built in 1999.&ldquo;In late 1999, I was told to sign for the house, but I refused because I saw that it was not properly done.&ldquo;I only took the keys because the house was built on my site. I made it very clear that I&rsquo;m not going to sign for this house, until they fix it.&rdquo;Municipal officials have visited her house several times and taken pictures. Nothing happened. She wrote to Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu in March.&ldquo;In April, I received a response. They said they received my letter and they promised to assist me.&rdquo;A local official, a Mrs Bham, visited her in August, and asked her why she signed for the house if she was not happy with it.&ldquo;I told her that I did not sign for the house. She left and promised to come back, but she never did.&rdquo;In winter her shack is very cold and in summer it is so hot she struggles to stay indoors. She recently spent several days in hospital.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do. I&rsquo;ve tried everything,&rdquo; she says.Sisulu&rsquo;s spokesperson Ndivhuwo Mabaya says the matter was referred back to municipality for investigation.GroundUp made several attempts to get comment, but the spokesperson and the responsible official at the municipality remained unreachable.- News24
