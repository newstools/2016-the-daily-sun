LEBOGANG Manwadu fell in love when she was only 19.But her days of happiness ended and Lebogang (31) from Mabuya Park in Vosloorus believes the man she once loved put a tokoloshe in her body .Lebogang said she no longer&rsquo;s involved with Sifiso Mhlanga (33) but an invisible man started bonking her when she still was with him. &ldquo;I was pregnant when the dreams started. Even when Sifiso was away I would still wake up with a wet body after dreams of sex with a man I didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;She went with Sifiso to a sangoma. &ldquo;The sangoma cut my body and smeared muthi in the cuts.&rdquo; But it didn&rsquo;t help, so they visited many sangomas and prophets. &ldquo;We got muthi to drink and sprinkle around, but nothing worked.&rdquo;Lebogang went to live at her mum&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;But the tokoloshe came back if I was at Sifiso&rsquo;s place.&rdquo; Sifiso said he is no longer with Lebogang but denied putting a tokoloshe in her body.&ldquo;She is crazy. When I met her, she already had her problems.&rdquo; He confirmed he and Lebogang went to sangomas without success. &ldquo;She must stop saying I put a tokoloshe in her body and deal with her problems,&rdquo; he said.
