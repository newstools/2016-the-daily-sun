MOREEN Katse says her family will be homeless this Christmas. Moreen claims her tenants have evicted her out of her own home. But the tenants allege she sold them the house for R50 000. According to the 58-year-old from Tshepiso in Soweto, she first met Harry and Gladys Mahlatsi in 2008.&ldquo;I said they could rent my RDP as I was living with a relative at the time,&rdquo; said Moreen. She said when things did not work out with the relative, she asked the couple to move out.&ldquo;They just erected a shack in the yard. Now they claim that they paid me R50 000. The title deed is in my name so I don&rsquo;t understand how they bought the house.&rdquo; Gladys and Harry told the Daily Sun Moreen defrauded them. &ldquo;She sold us the house for R50 000 and promised to change ownership.&ldquo;She gave us fake documents and when we went to check at the housing department, we found the house was still under her name,&rdquo; they claimed.Human settlements department spokesman Mogomotsi Mogodiri said as Moreen was the registered owner she has the right to evict the couple. He added that his department will investigate the matter and forward it to the civil claims court.
