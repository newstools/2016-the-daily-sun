Twins Fikile and Simangele Mashele (30) are both blind in one eye, but Sassa does not think they&rsquo;re blind enough. They claim that they were told that they don&rsquo;t qualify for disability grants, and must look for work.The twins, from Sebokeng near Malelane in Mpumalanga, have been partially blind since they were born. They were told that they became blind because of bad lighting in the incubators they were put in at the hospital. Fikile said: &ldquo;My one eye is cloudy, irritated and painful most of time. At school, I sat in the front of the class, but I still could not see. My sister and I had to drop out in grade 8, when we were 25. It was humiliating to be in a classroom with kids as young as 14.&rdquo; Simangele said doctors wrote them medical certificates to explain that they were living with disabilities, and they presented these to Sassa officials. &ldquo;But they turned us down, claiming that because we can still partially see with one eye, we don&rsquo;t qualify. I once found work as a domestic worker, but found the work too hard.&rdquo;Simangele has three children who receive child support grants. She survives on the money. She said she had no choice but to have babies so she could cash in on the grants. Senzeni Ngubeni, Sassa spokesman, said the sisters must go back to their office to be booked for an appointment to see a doctor.
