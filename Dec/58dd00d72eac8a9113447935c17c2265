WHEN the driver of the speeding Toyota Corolla realised that he was approaching a roadblock, he tried to make a U-turn in the middle of traffic.But cops soon surrounded the vehicle, and immediately discovered the cause of the driver&rsquo;s hasty attempt to retreat. He had several bags of dagga stuffed in the boot.The man (54), along with three women aged 40, 42 and 51 were immediately arrested on the D401 between Songeni and Cottondale, outside Thulamahashe in Mpumalanga, on Saturday night. Constable Sonile Usinga said cops had signalled for him to stop when he attempted to make a U-turn. But traffic had already piled up behind his vehicle.&ldquo;One of the women said they were on the way from Kanyamazane, outside Mbombela. They were en route to deliver the dagga in Phalaborwa, Limpopo, about 200km away. &ldquo;The street value of the dagga found in the boot is R65 000. Police confiscated their vehicle and the dagga. They will appear in the Mhala Magistrates Court today.&rdquo;
