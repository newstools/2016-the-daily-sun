IT WILL be a battle of the southpaws when Thabiso &ldquo;The Rock&rdquo; Mchunu goes toe-to-toe with the Ukraine&rsquo;s hot prospect, Oleksandr Usyk, for the World Boxing Organisation (WBO) world cruiserweight title at the Forum in Inglewood, in the US today.These two hard-hitting boxers will square off on the undercard bout of legendary boxing great Bernard &ldquo;The Executioner&rdquo; Hopkins&rsquo;s clash with Joe Smith jnr for the vacant World Boxing Council international light heavyweight crown. With this fight Hopkins is bidding farewell to his illustrious boxing career, which has spanned more than three decades. Mchunu, who left for the USA on Wednesday, said he was razor sharp and ready to deliver against the unbeaten champion. He said: &ldquo;It is a great feeling to fight on Hopkin&rsquo;s undercard, especially when he is hanging up his gloves. Also, to challenge for the WBO title is a dream come true. It&rsquo;s an opportunity I have been waiting for and it&rsquo;s up to me to deliver.&ldquo;The champion is a brilliant boxer and I&rsquo;m expecting a tough contest, but I&rsquo;m ready to bring the title home. I think he will be the one under pressure, because he will be out to impress, as this is his debut on American soil,&rdquo; added Mchunu.Usyk, the 2012 Olympic gold medallist, is a hard hitter with a 90% knockout ratio. He will be making his first title defence of the belt he claimed when he beat the previously undefeated Krzysztof Glowacki to capture the crown. Usyk has won all 10 his fights, scoring nine knockouts. His opponents have included three of Mchunu&rsquo;s fellow-countrymen, Daniel Bruwer, Danie Venter and Johnny Muller.However, the KwaZulu-Natal born fighter, who boasts a record of 17 wins and two defeats, remains optimistic that he will bring home the WBO crown.
