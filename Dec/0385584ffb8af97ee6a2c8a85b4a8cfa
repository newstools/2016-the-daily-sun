Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez appears to be taking a firm stance in contract negotiations after stating that it is up to the club to "show confidence" in him.Like so many other high-profile players in England's top flight, the Chile international is reportedly being courted by big-spending Chinese clubs.And, as contract talks continue to drag on, the 27-year-old has indicated that he's more than willing to commit his future to the London outfit, provided they offer him terms that match his value to the side.When asked about how his contract talks were progressing, Sanchez told&nbsp;Sky Sports: "It really doesn't depend on me so much as it does the club, if they want to show confidence in me."I'm very happy at the club. I love It here, I love all the staff, I love the coaches, I love all the employees who work for us."I'm very grateful for everybody here. As I say, I'm very happy, so it depends more on Arsenal."Sanchez joined the Gunners from Barcelona in a deal worth a reported &pound;31.7 million, ahead of the 2014/15 campaign.To date, the forward has made 116 appearances in all competitions for Arsene Wenger's side, bagging 56 goals in the process.
