HEAD of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate, Robert McBride, is back in the hot seat as two arms of the justice system slug it out! Yesterday, Moses Dlamini, spokesman for Ipid, announced that McBride has been asked to hand in a warning statement to the Hawks as part of their investigation into him.Dlamini said he was expected to meet McBride during the day to discuss when or if he would reply to the Hawks. According to Eyewitness News, the Hawks sent a letter to McBride asking him to make the statement before 11am. The statement was needed in connection with an attempted murder case from 2007 in Boksburg and a case of a stolen BMW X5.Both incidents happened when McBride was serving as Ekurhuleni Metro police chief. But a report has emerged that senior police and Hawks investigators have been plotting to implicate McBride.A whistleblower told Eyewitness News he was contacted by a lieutenant-colonel in 2007 to draft an affidavit. The cop said the affidavit was meant to implicate McBride in the attempted murder of heist kingpin Marco Singh.But the state withdrew charges against McBride and his two co-accused, former director of investigations Matthew Sesoko and former head of Ipid in Limpopo, Innocent Khuba, in November.
