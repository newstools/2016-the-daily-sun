SFISO Ncwane&rsquo;s life was celebrated with his hit songs during his memorial service in Durban KwaZulu- Natal yesterday. Hundreds of his fans packed eThekwini Community Church in Durban to pay their last respects, and the church soon got so full that many had to stand outside. Sfiso&rsquo;s songs played at full blast as speaker after speaker took to the podium to share their memories of the gospel singer, who died of kidney failure on Monday. Sfiso&rsquo;s wife, Ayanda, was at the ceremony with her eldest son, Ngcweti (13). Sfiso&rsquo;s sister, Gugu told Daily Sun they would always be grateful to everyone who supported them. Gugu and her family said earlier they wouldn&rsquo;t attend the service because they couldn&rsquo;t afford transport, but Sfiso&rsquo;s colleagues in the music industry came to the rescue. &ldquo;KZN artists, including T&rsquo;zozo, DJ Merlon and Abanqobi, visited us at home on Wednesday afternoon and organised transport for my mum and the rest of the family to attend the service,&rdquo; she said. His mum Fikile couldn&rsquo;t hold back her tears during the service led by Pastor Vusi Dube. One of Sfiso&rsquo;s fans, Nomonde Buthelezi (29), said she skipped work to attend the service. The event was attended by celebrities like Linda Sibiya, Lvovo Dernago, T&rsquo;zozo and Malini.Gospel singers Sgwili Zuma, Andile Mbili, Fikile Mlomo, Dumi Mkokstad and Thobekile Mkhwanazi gave moving performances.
