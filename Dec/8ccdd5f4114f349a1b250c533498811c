FOR one day, the domestic workers were rich after allegedly stealing items worth R1 million from their boss. But the next day, the cops pounced on them and now they&rsquo;ll be spending Christmas behind bars. The two workers and their men friends were arrested and taken to Parkview Police Station in Joburg.They are now facing charges of house robbery and possession of suspected stolen property. Parkview police spokeswoman, Captain Tintswalo Sibeko, said the suspects were bust in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni on Saturday after allegedly robbing a house in Emmarentia the previous day. Sibeko said they took four plasma TVs, a suitcase with clothes, jewellery, a silver BMW and a silver Chrysler Voyager. The value of the stolen items is believed to be about R1 million. She said the police recovered the stolen goods. All four suspects appeared in the Joburg Magistrates Court on Monday.Three of them were detained, while the fourth was released due to lack of evidence. Sibeko said the employer told the cops he came home to find two men in his lounge. One of them pointed a firearm at him and told him to lie on the floor. &ldquo;The suspects took him to a bedroom and he was tied up with a rope. &ldquo;They demanded cash and the keys to the safe but he told them he didn&rsquo;t have the keys,&rdquo; said Sibeko. She said when the victim&rsquo;s wife and children arrived home later, the suspects also tied them up and took the keys to the safe from the son. They then took the contents of the safe, four TVs and the two cars.
