ANC MP Juli Kilian has raised concerns that SABC board minutes provided to Parliament's ad hoc committee looking into the broadcaster's fitness might have been tampered with.Kilian raised the issue during former board member Rachel Kalidass' testimony before the ad hoc committee today.Kalidass read out a section of the board meeting minutes from 7 July 2014, the date that former COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng was appointed to the position permanently at a surprise night meeting."The extract that you have provided here on page six does not appear in our submission from the company secretary. Our document looks different," Kilian told her during a round of questions.Kalidass said board members received individual bundles of board meeting minutes while they were serving.She said her bundle is still intact and she would be happy to provide the inquiry with her original copies.The committee's documents were provided by former SABC company secretary Theresa Geldenhuys, who testified on Tuesday.MPs told News24 afterwards that the minutes provided to the committee were not stamped or signed.The section of the minutes in question concern Communications Minister Faith Muthambi's reasons for being present at the SABC building the night Motsoeneng was appointed, and her motivation for wanting to speed up the process.Her minutes also listed which board members were in support of Motsoeneng's appointment: Mbulaheni Maguvhe, Leah Khumalo, Vuyo Mhlakaza, the late Hope Zinde, Dr Aaron Tshidzumba and then-chairperson Ellen Tshabalala.The board members who disagreed were Kalidass, Ronnie Lubisi and Krish Naidoo. They were of the view that normal advertising processes needed to be followed first.Bongani Khumalo and Vusi Mavuso abstained. Mavuso told the committee on Friday that he did not want to legitimise the process and was strongly against it.Kilian said it would be very important to compare the two batches of minutes, as the differences were a "concern".Committee chairperson Vincent Smith asked Kalidass to leave her bundle of minutes with the committee before she left.DA MP Phumzile van Damme told News24 afterwards that if true, it was appalling that people under oath would come to Parliament and doctor minutes.She said it would be perjury if that was the case, and criminal charges should be laid.&nbsp;&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/mps-concerned-sabc-board-documents-might-have-been-doctored-20161215
