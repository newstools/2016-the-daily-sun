WHEN gogo Mavis Zwane&rsquo;s leg was amputated in May, her 25-year-old daughter allegedly deserted her. The 66-year-old gogo from Umzinyathi, north of Durban, said she now relies on caregivers for assistance.The gogo, who is in a wheelchair, claimed her daughter started acting strangely shortly after she returned from Addington Hospital.&ldquo;She would leave me for nearly a week with her two kids, who are both under the age of five.&ldquo;She would go boozing with her friends for days and completely ignore her household chores,&rdquo; she claimed.&ldquo;When I confronted her about neglecting her duties, she left and told me that she wanted me to die alone. She then deleted her contact number from my cellphone,&rdquo; claimed the gogo, adding that she has no intention of leaving her three-roomed house.Ncumisa Ndelu, KZN Department of Social Development spokeswoman, said gogo Mavis needs to apply at the South African Social Security Agency for a secondary grant called grant-in-aid.Sassa provincial spokesman Mbizeni Mdlalose said a sum of R350 will be added to the gogo&rsquo;s pension grant money to help her ease the burden.&ldquo;This type of a grant is only given to frail and disabled pensioners so that they can pay those who take care of them regularly. &ldquo;Mavis should visit our offices or call 0800 601011 if she is not able to travel.&rdquo;
