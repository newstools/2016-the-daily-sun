WHATEVER the ancestors&rsquo; wishes are, it is best to follow them, even if it means placing a bath on their grave!This photograph from a cemetery in Ekurhuleni had mourners scratching their heads in confusion.&ldquo;This is strange. I have never seen such a thing,&rdquo; said a mourner on Sunday.Others guessed the family who placed the bath on the grave could be honouring the wishes of their departed loved one. &ldquo;Maybe it was dead person&rsquo;s wish, or he or she liked bathing and requested it before their death,&rdquo; said another mourner.Sangoma Nyoka Ndebele said ancestors, like the living, needed to be respected and that it wasn&rsquo;t strange to honour them like this.&ldquo;It all depends on their taste and what they loved when they were still alive.&ldquo;If they loved flowers, you&rsquo;ll plant flowers. &ldquo;If they liked to have baths, you can put a bath on their grave.&ldquo;It is our culture to look after ancestors, as they are our guardians.&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll come to you in a dream to tell what they want, and you have to follow their instructions. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t honour the ancestors&rsquo; wishes, you risk creating bad luck for yourself,&rdquo; said Ndebele.&ldquo;They may want you to slaughter an animal for them and place the skin on top of their grave to cover them. &ldquo;They are so many things that they may demand from the living. If you want blessings, you have to do as you are told. We don&rsquo;t have to know why this particular family put a bath on the grave to honour their ancestors. &ldquo;But I am sure the family will know what it means.&rdquo;Daily Sun would like to hear from the family what the bath means.
