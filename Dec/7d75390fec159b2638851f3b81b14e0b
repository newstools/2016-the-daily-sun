Mulaudzi said residents need to obey by-laws and should stay away from land where building of structures is prohibited by the municipality. He added that residents should make sure drains are cleaned regularly so they don&rsquo;t become blocked and cause flooding. &ldquo;Never try to cross flooded rivers, streets or streams. If you are in a low-lying area, check the water level and move to higher ground if the water level rises.&rdquo;
