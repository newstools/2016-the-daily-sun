POPULAR DJ and producer Citi Lyts of Washa and Vura fame nearly found himself in hot water!&ldquo;He kicked me,&rdquo; claimed Marilyn Beauty from Soweto.And here&rsquo;s what she told the People&rsquo;s Paper.&ldquo;On Sunday night I went out to Kong nightclub, in Rosebank, where I bumped into Citi and his friends, and joined them. I had known him for a couple of months after meeting at Kong.&ldquo;It seemed he had come driving in someone else&rsquo;s car, as he&rsquo;d had a quarrel with the girl who owned it &ndash; and didn&rsquo;t want to give her the keys.&ldquo;We left the club and were driving to his place in Midrand. I asked him why he didn&rsquo;t give the girl her keys.&ldquo;In Midrand, he stopped the car, got angry and started to hit me. He threw me down and hit me for no reason. So I went and called the cops.&rdquo;Marilyn told the SunTeam she had bruises on her back and neck and was still in pain.&ldquo;When cops came I told them I was opening a case. Citi told them it was a mistake and apologised.&ldquo;One of the cops advised us to sort things out because Citi seemed to be remorseful. I felt sorry for him and believed his apology at the time, so I stopped pressing charges.&rdquo;According to Marilyn, his apology was an act &ndash; and after police left he was angry again.&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t want to take me home and had still not sorted out my medical bill, as per our agreement.&rdquo;Marilyn said she would like to warn other girls about Citi, and added: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not who he says he is.&rdquo;When the SunTeam called Citi Lyts for comment, he acknowledged knowing Marilyn and that an incident had taken place.But he denied laying hands on her. &ldquo;I never hit her. I have witnesses, as there were two other girls in the car,&rdquo; he said.He said it was the second time he had met Marilyn. They had first met at Kong and hooked up.&ldquo;I bumped into her at Kong Sunday night and she asked to go with me. Halfway to Midrand, she wanted to be taken home to Soweto. That irritated me, as it was a long way to Soweto, and I had asked her where she wanted to go when we left the club.&ldquo;When we got to Midrand she became dramatic and caused a scene. She took my wallet. I chased her around the complex &ndash; and that&rsquo;s when she tripped and fell. I took my belt out and threatened to whip her &ndash; as she had my wallet.&rdquo;Citi, who is signed to Ambitious Records, said Marilyn ran out of the complex and returned with cops a few minutes later.&ldquo;When cops arrived I explained what had happened. I didn&rsquo;t beg her not to open a case. We spoke about it and she decided not to go through with it. Cops left and she asked to be taken home.&ldquo;I then ubered her home. I&rsquo;m surprised she claims I beat her up. I never laid a finger on her.&ldquo;Nor did I promise her I&rsquo;d pay for anything. She can however send me the bill from the doctor.&ldquo;What&rsquo;s funny about this incident is that Marilyn told one of her friends I had damaged her phone, and she needed to get a new one.&ldquo;She must stop lying,&rdquo; said Citi Lyts.
