GOGO Onnicah Moloisane (71) from Mmametlhake, Mpumalanga was over the moon when she received her RDP house.But her dream home has turned her life into a nightmare.The gogo said: &ldquo;I thought my prayers were answered. But now I want my shack back.&ldquo;The roof and floors are cracked. Rain leaks into my house and on windy days, the roof blows off.&rdquo;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sleep at night because I have to look after my six grandchildren. The tiles on the roof keep falling. I fear my grandkids might get hurt while they are sleeping.&rdquo;Gogo Onnicah said she has to sleep in her kitchen because it is too dangerous to sleep in the bedroom.&ldquo;I cannot afford to rebuild the roof. A builder told me the walls are not strong enough to keep the roof in place. They have to remove the roof and rebuild the walls. I cannot afford that because I survive on my pension grant.&rdquo;Councillor Ben Lehong said he was not aware of the gogo&rsquo;s situation.&ldquo;I hold monthly meetings with the residents. I don&rsquo;t take complaints over the phone. &ldquo;She must attend one of the meetings.&rdquo;
