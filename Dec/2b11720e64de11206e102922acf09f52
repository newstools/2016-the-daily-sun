TWO people are fighting over the ownership of an RDP house. Ntombomzi Klass (43) of Nompumelelo kasi, East London applied for an RDP in the late 1990s. While she was still waiting for the house, she got married. When she finally got the house in 2005, she decided to rent it out to someone as she was living with her husband. Ntombomzi&rsquo;s marriage did not last. Her husband left her and went to Cape Town.In 2012 Ntombomzi died. She left a young boy, Amyoli Klass (4), who was about two months old at the time. Ntombomzi&rsquo;s relative, Nonkululeko Jilingisi (32) now looks after Amyoli after Ntombomzi&rsquo;s death. Nonkululeko went to the tenant who rented Ntombomzi&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;But when I got there I found another tenant, not the one who was renting from Ntombomzi,&rdquo; she said.She said when she asked the man who gave him access to the house, he told her he was renting the house from Mzoli Gxekwa. &ldquo;I had gone there to tell the guy to rent from me as I have to look after Amyoli. But when I called Mzoli, he said he bought the house from my late aunt, Ntombomzi and that there&rsquo;s a new tenant. He said I must pay him R15 000 if I wanted the house back,&rdquo; said Nonkululeko. Mzoli said: &ldquo;I bought the house for R15 000 from Ntombomzi. We went to the lawyers with one witness when we concluded the purchase.&rdquo; Lwandile Sicwetsha of Eastern Cape human settlements said if the house is over eight years old the department does not control it. He said the department cannot intervene in this matter.
