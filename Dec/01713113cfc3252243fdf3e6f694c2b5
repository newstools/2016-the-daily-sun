HENDRICK Maluleke (25) and Beauty Manana (39) insist that they paid their funeral policies&rsquo; premiums religiously every month.They did this so that in the event of family members dying, they would be able to lay their loved ones to rest with dignity.But when an undertaker allegedly failed to fulfil his side of the bargain, they claimed he promised to pay them out in cash. Hendrick, of Ramgelatsane near Siyabuswa in Mpumalanga, said six months later, he is still waiting for the payout.Hendrick said he took out the policy with Phakama Funeral Scheme more than 12 months ago, paying R230 a month to cover his whole family.&ldquo;When my gogo died in June, the undertaker failed to bury her,&rdquo; he claimed. &ldquo;I had to fork out cash and pay another undertaker.&rdquo; Hendrick claimed the funeral scheme boss, Ali Mkhwanazi, said that because the company had failed to honour the policy stipulations, he would receive R12 000. &ldquo;But they never paid and now I&rsquo;m being sent from pillar to post. &ldquo;The undertaker doesn&rsquo;t even take my calls. &ldquo;The last time we spoke he said he lodged a claim and is still waiting for payment.&rdquo; Beauty &ndash; also from Siyabuswa &ndash; claimed the funeral undertaker owed her R5 500. Beauty said she joined the scheme last year and has been paying R350 every month. &ldquo;The undertaker came to bury my father who died in June, but did not give me the R5 500 in cash for groceries as part of the contract,&rdquo; she claimed. &ldquo;He promised to pay me R1 000 for funeral preparation within 48 hours but he never did. &ldquo;I was also supposed to get R4 500 for a cow as part of the policy.&ldquo;I have tried to contact him but he does not answer my calls anymore. &ldquo;He does not even respond to text messages. He once asked for my bank account to deposit the money, but he never did.&rdquo; Mkhwanazi said the funeral policy contracts that the clients were paying for did not entail cash payouts. &ldquo;Their policy contracts cover burials only,&rdquo; said Mkhwanazi. &ldquo;They must read their contracts carefully. I don&rsquo;t owe them any money .&rdquo;
