THE Gambia's sporting community yesterday mourned a popular young wrestler who drowned in the Mediterranean attempting to reach Italy.Ali Mbengu (22) died last Friday when his boat capsized, his coach Pateh Nying told AFP, as the country's wrestling federation begged young people to think twice before making the dangerous crossing.Wrestling is hugely popular in the Gambia and in neighbouring Senegal, where bouts steeped in traditional rituals are watched by hundreds of spectators.Coach Nying told how the wrestler, also known as "Mille Franc" (&ldquo;Thousand Franc&rdquo;, referring to the currency), had left for Libya in 2014. Many migrants get stuck in the unstable north African nation, working to pay off debts before finally setting sail."His plan was to cross to Italy by boat," Nying said."One of the survivors called his brother and informed him about the incident. The caller told the brother that only 10 people survived when the boat capsized on the high seas."Some of the country's finest wrestlers have resettled in Europe after boarding makeshift boats from Libya to Italy.The news of Mille Franc's death came less than a week after the announcement that the goalkeeper of the Gambia's national women's football team had also died crossing the Mediterranean.Fatim Jawara, is believed to have been just 19.Gambian President Yahya Jammeh said in a televised address last year that "true Muslims" would encourage their sons and daughters to take up job opportunities which are available at home.In reality 60 percent of the population live in poverty, and a third survive on $1,25 (about R18) or less a day, according to the UN.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/gambia-mourns-popular-wrestler-drowned-in-mediterranean-20161110-5
