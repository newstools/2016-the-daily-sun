PUBLIC Protect Busisiwe Mkhwebane was silent on her predecessor&rsquo;s &ldquo;State of Capture&rdquo; report when she spoke at an event in Durban yesterday.Instead, she told a roomful of African dignitaries about the exploitation of the natural resources on the continent.&ldquo;The precious stones deep within our land will no longer be exported raw for processing on foreign soil to swell the economies of the super powers, while the real owners of the natural resources remain in the hive of poverty.&rdquo;She was delivering the opening address at the African Ombudsman and Mediators fifth biennial general assembly.She spoke about bringing Africa together, to &ldquo;make a continent that generations to come can enjoy&rdquo;.During his address, KwaZulu-Natal Human Settlements MEC Ravi Pillay congratulated Mkhwebane on her appointment.In a veiled compliment to Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s tenure as public protector, Pillay said robust institutions of government took hard work and dedication.&ldquo;We are honoured that successful public protectors in South Africa have inspired the confidence in our people by being accessible and trustworthy to all persons and communities.&rdquo;He said the public protector&rsquo;s office had responded to complaints promptly and with rigour and consistently promoted good governance.He said that in recent days the work of the public protector&rsquo;s office had been in the spotlight.&ldquo;Having read the latest report, I think there are more cutting edges to come as to what kind of investigative powers there are. Let me not take it any further and get into any trouble.&rdquo;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/public-protector-silent-on-state-capture-report-20161104&nbsp;
