FORMER Mamelodi Sundowns defender, Punch Masenamela (30), is said to be broke.This comes after he&rsquo;d allegedly lost his yellow BMW 1 Series and his house in Kempton Park to the repo man.Punch was booted off the Polokwane City squad in February.This after he had allegedly &ldquo;lost his way&rdquo;. Although it&rsquo;s unclear when the former Rise And Shine player lost his assets, sources close to him told Sunday Sun he&rsquo;s gone from a BMW to driving a white Ford Bantam.Sources who saw him visit his dad and two brothers in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, claimed Punch seemed broke.They claimed he was wearing a white no-name tracksuit and parked his car a street away from his home.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got problems. He neglected his family and went to live in the suburbs thinking it was a good idea. He made the wrong choice.&ldquo;After he was kicked out by Polokwane City, he&rsquo;s been clubless and it&rsquo;s not looking good,&rdquo; the source said.Another source said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad that he failed to make good investment decisions when he was still playing for Chiefs and Sundowns. He failed to renovate his RDP home. Instead, he went and bought a house in Ivory Park. Some players need proper guidance when it comes to finances.&rdquo; Punch was not available for comment but his agent, Jazzman Mahlakgane, said: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such thing. There&rsquo;s propaganda against him.&ldquo;His BMW was involved in an accident while he was still playing for Sundowns. So what if he&rsquo;s driving a Ford Bantam? &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no house that&rsquo;s been repossessed. My player is currently clubless and training with a Vodacom team until he gets a club.&rdquo;
