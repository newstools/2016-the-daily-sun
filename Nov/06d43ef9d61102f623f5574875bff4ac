THE three thugs came to rob Peter Matawo, but they would not do so while dirty and on empty stomachs.So first they forced Peter to give them water to bath and a change of clothes &ndash; and then demanded food! And after a hearty meal, instead of thanks, Peter stared into the barrel of a gun as the gang continued to rob him.Peter (33), who owns a spaza shop in Dindela near Komatipoort, Mpumalanga, said the daring robbery left him baffled.&ldquo;The men broke a wall to gain entry to the shop. As they were pounding the wall my younger brother screamed for help, but they laughed at him and continued hammering the wall. They shouted back, saying no one would risk their lives to protect us.&rdquo;Once inside, the thugs pointed guns at Peter and his brother.&ldquo;They raided my cupboard and chose my best, clean clothes.&rdquo; &ldquo;After they got dressed, they demanded that I prepare them dinner of tinned fish and bread. They ate while cracking jokes about my scared brother.&rdquo;Peter said he had to face the humiliation of having to joke and chat with the trio for about an hour-and-a-half until they finished eating. &ldquo;Then out came the guns again!&rdquo; he said, adding that they robbed him of stock worth R6 000 as well as airtime worth more than R2 000.Peter&rsquo;s brother, Daga Matawo (23), said their shop had been robbed five times since 2014. &ldquo;Thugs always fled as quickly as they stormed the shop, but these three were relaxed, cheeky and in no hurry. We opened cases in the past and nothing happened, so now we don&rsquo;t bother.&rdquo; Lieutenant Mzwandile Nyambi said Peter should open a case. He said the other cases he opened were being investigated.
