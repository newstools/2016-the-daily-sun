The NPA&rsquo;s decision to withdraw fraud charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan is proof there was no political interference in the matter, the ANC Women&rsquo;s League said on Monday. NPA head Shaun Abrahams&rsquo; decision was proof that the organisation was independent and operating according to the Constitution, the ANCWL said in a statement. No individual had the power to interfere in NPA&rsquo;s constitutional mandate, the statement reads.The league called on its members, supporters, and society at large to respect the decision. Anybody else should approach the courts.Gordhan and former Sars officials Oupa Magashula and Ivan Pillay were facing fraud charges. This related to Pillay&rsquo;s being granted early retirement in 2010, and subsequently being rehired on a contract. Abrahams said he made his decision following representations from both Magashula and Pillay.Gordhan refused to make representations, but Abrahams said the Hawks had documented his version of events.
