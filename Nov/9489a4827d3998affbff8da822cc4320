BUCS defender, Edwin Gyimah, plays a double game!He has a stunning nyatsi called Cara . . . AND A WIFE WHO&rsquo;S PLOTTING REVENGE!The Ghanaian anchor&rsquo;s been scoring in bedroom games since 2012 with the gorgeous Cara Mangena.A source close to the situation told Sunday Sun it took four years for Edwin&rsquo;s lovely wife, Mimi, to work out what was happening.&ldquo;Mimi befriended Cara so she could keep tabs on them. And finally, she realised what was going on behind her back,&rdquo; the source said.The diski mole went on to allege: &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s when she lost her marbles! She told Cara she was going to take her pictures to a &lsquo;wise man&rsquo; in Ghana &ndash; a man with powers to make her life a living hell.&rdquo;Sunday Sun contacted Cara, who confirmed the allegations, saying: &ldquo;Edwin and I broke up in May this year. But recently I&rsquo;ve been receiving threatening messages from his wife. My life is in danger, I&rsquo;m scared.&rdquo;And a fuming Mimi told the SunTeam: &ldquo;Cara&rsquo;s been busy with my husband for five years. She&rsquo;s a bitch of note!&ldquo;She must sit down and close her legs. Because she&rsquo;s opening them for material things. I&rsquo;ve got a text message she sent my husband, asking him to buy her Louis Vuitton bags and other expensive stuff.&ldquo;This Cara is a husband-snatcher, and she doesn&rsquo;t know me very well. I&rsquo;m going to bewitch her. She must pray to God to get a man of her own. God won&rsquo;t bless you with someone else&rsquo;s husband.&rdquo;Gyimah wasn&rsquo;t available for comment as he was in camp. But Bucs spokesman, Floyd Mbhele, said: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a private matter and the club can&rsquo;t be involved.&rdquo;
