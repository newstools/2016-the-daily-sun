He decided to fight the addiction in 2014.&ldquo;I took the opportunity when the leaders of the community encouraged me and 12 other addicts to undergo a six-month spiritual rehabilitation cleansing. They were tired of our criminal actions.&rdquo;He said they attended Bible studies during the cleansing period.&ldquo;We were called the 12 disciples in the centre, but today I am the only survivor. &ldquo;The others relapsed a few months after they were integrated back into the community. They were all eager to fight the addiction when they were still inside the centre.&rdquo;&ldquo;When I feel weak I read the Bible.&rdquo;Mpho said the 11 months that he&rsquo;s been drug free haven&rsquo;t been easy.Mpho&rsquo;s mother, Marriam Mkhari (47), said she is happy that her son is off drugs. &ldquo;I fear that he might go back to drugs if he doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do.
