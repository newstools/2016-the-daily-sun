&ldquo;MY FIANCE of 15 years is married to someone else!&rdquo; These were the words of devastated Alida Annie, who said she has just learned that the love of her life had been lying to her. Making matters worse, the 46-year-old from Naledi in Soweto told Daily Sun her partner wanted to kick her out of their house and have his wife move in! &ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;ve wasted more than 15 years of my life. &ldquo;He promised me heaven and earth. I have even raised his children like my own. I treated him like a king and this is what he does to me?&rdquo; Alida said she got the shock of her life when a woman she had never met before came to her house and claimed to be married to her partner, Veli Dube. &ldquo;I knew he had been with someone else before because he has two children. &ldquo;But he told me that relationship was over.&ldquo;He now tells me he wants to start a new life with his family and I must leave the house. He acts as though he bought everything in our house. I have been sleeping on a couch at my family&rsquo;s home. I have nothing to my name but I want some of my belongings back.&rdquo; Veli told the SunTeam that Alida was telling lies. &ldquo;That woman is talking rubbish. &ldquo;She knew I was married and I didn&rsquo;t kick her out.&ldquo;She is the one who left. She even accused me of sleeping with her sister.&rdquo; Veli&rsquo;s wife, Norrah, said Alida had stolen Veli from her. &ldquo;We have two kids and she knows that. She must grow up and stop acting like a child.&rdquo;
