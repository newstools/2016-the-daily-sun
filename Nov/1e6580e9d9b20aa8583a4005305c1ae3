PAUL Nyamunda (46) of Soshanguve, north of Tshwane says his vukavuka muthi helps save marriages.According to Paul, the muthi is a traditional plant that has been used for decades to treat low sex drive. &ldquo;It is a traditional Viagra,&rdquo; he said.He said he started selling the muthi on the side of the busy Soutpanberg Road two years ago.&ldquo;Many men are shy to go to the clinic to get help for their 4-5s. They know here we do not judge them. I am a man who understands their manhood problems.&rdquo;&ldquo;I also treat those who have STIs.&ldquo;They have multiple sex partners and when they get sick they cannot disclose this to their partners. But after two days of taking the vukavuka they get better. &ldquo;They are shy to go to the clinic because they are ashamed of their illness,&rdquo; he said.One of his loyal customers, Jerry Mabaso (54), told Daily Sun that he takes the vukavuka twice a year.&ldquo;When I take the vukavuka I feel like a new person. My blood starts flowing better and I am able to satisfy my girlfriend in bed.&ldquo;Like a car, my 4-5 needs to be serviced after a certain period of being used.&ldquo;When it starts being weak and I get tired very quickly when I make love I know it is time for it to be serviced. I am going to pass the secret to my sons when they are older too,&rdquo; Jerry said.
