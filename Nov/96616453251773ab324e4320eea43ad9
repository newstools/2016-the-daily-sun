THEY go from house to house claiming to be jewellery cleaners but their aim is not to clean. The group of thugs steal people&rsquo;s gold rings, watches, earrings and necklaces as soon as they turn their backs! Their latest victims were Gilbert and Emma Ndala from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni. They told Daily Sun the thugs knocked on their door last Wednesday and promised to make their wedding rings sparkle like new. The couple fell for the trick &ndash; and today their ring fingers are bare. &ldquo;They told us to wait while they cleaned the rings. We trusted them because we knew they were expecting a payment but we became suspicious when we looked outside and saw the men had disappeared,&rdquo; said Gilbert. Thelma Khoza from Etwatwa said the thieves said they would clean her jewellery for only R20. &ldquo;They had a bag containing cleaning chemicals so I believed them. I took off my rings and they put them in a chemical in my presence. They then told me they had used the wrong chemical and they had to take my ring away to clean. That was the last time I saw them.&rdquo; Thelma said the thugs left behind a gadget but she couldn&rsquo;t figure out what it was used for. She went to the police but they told her she couldn&rsquo;t open a case because she had handed over the rings voluntarily. The police advised people to be on the alert and not to hand over their possessions to people they didn&rsquo;t know.
