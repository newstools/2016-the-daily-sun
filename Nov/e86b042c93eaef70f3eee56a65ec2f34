TWO illegal initiation schools have been closed down.The cops and the North West Department of Traditional Affairs closed down the schools on Monday.Departmental task team member Gobusamang Mere and the police found six girls behind an RDP house in Tigane kasi. The girls and three women aged between 21 and 34, were all taken to the local police station. The women are the suspected owners of the school.At another initiation school on a farm near Hartbeesfontein, 20 boys were found but only three were initiates.The three were also taken to the police station together with the people in charge. In the end the boys and girls were returned to their homes, and the initiation schools were destroyed. The people in charge of the school were released. Mere said: &ldquo;Our people need to respect the law and comply with traditional rules. &ldquo;Parents need to check if the initiation school is allowed to operate.&rdquo;He said the ward councillor, the police, a retired nurse or a traditional health practitioner also have to be consulted before a school is opened.Mere added that an initiate needs to be examined in a health centre before going to the school, and no initiation school may be conducted within 5km of a housing settlement.When asked why the suspects were not charged, Mere said: &ldquo;We later found out the owners of the schools had filled forms at the local police station to have their schools accredited. &ldquo;However, the forms were not sent to the relevant department, so their applications could be approved. That is why they were released.&rdquo;
