A MAN suspected of involvement in the leak of the matric maths exam paper appeared in the Giyani Magistrates Court yesterday. Tinyiko Khosa (52), a director at New Era Combined School in Malamulele, Limpopo handed himself over to the cops on Tuesday. Basic education spokesman Elijah Mhlanga said the police had been able to trace all pupils who received the paper on WhatsApp before it was written. However, it had not yet been announced how many pupils at the affected school, Giyani High School, had seen the paper. &ldquo;The department will look into the matter to decide whether they will have to rewrite the paper or not,&rdquo; he said. Hawks spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said: &ldquo;The investigation led us to Gauteng, where several people provided statements, and we were able to trace the origin of the leak back to Limpopo.&rdquo; Khosa appeared in court briefly on charges of theft, fraud and corruption. He was calm and he smiled when he entered the packed courtroom. The matter was postponed until Wednesday when he would make a formal bail application.
