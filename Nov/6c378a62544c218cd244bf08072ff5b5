STUDENTS at the University of Pretoria became violent yesterday morning following a night vigil in support of #FeesMustFall. They took to the streets and caused chaos in Hatfield, Tshwane, burning branches, barricading the entrance to the university and damaging property.After they put large rocks on the road, the students were dispersed by cops using teargas, stun grenades and rubber bullets. Some shops in Hatfield Plaza were damaged and a campus bus was stoned. Protester Kabelo Mahlabongwane (22) said: &ldquo;Management is disrespecting us. They reply with violence instead of hearing what we need.&rdquo;He said they want charges of public violence and malicious damage to property against three of their leaders to be dropped. The three appeared in the Pretoria Magistrates Court yesterday and were released on R1 000 bail each. The case was postponed to next Tuesday. University spokeswoman Anna-Retha Bouwer said the academic programme continued as scheduled. Meanwhile at Wits University in Joburg no incidents were reported over the weekend. Exams at the University of Cape Town and the University of the Western Cape will start on Monday.
