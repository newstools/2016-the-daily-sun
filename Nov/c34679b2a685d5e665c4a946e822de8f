AS THE festive season &shy;approaches, South Africans have to work out ways to get more from the little they have.But thugs are always thinking of more scams to cheat suffering people out of their money.The latest scam is again targeting Sassa beneficiaries, sending them text messages that urge them to get new &ldquo;green&rdquo; cards before January. Sassa has warned that it would never communicate with its beneficiaries via SMS. It warned beneficiaries not to respond to any of these messages. It said no new cards were currently being rolled out and it wasn&rsquo;t true that beneficiaries had to get new cards before 1 January. Sassa said grant beneficiaries should also be on the lookout for people pretending to be from Sassa requesting their personal and card details.- Meanwhile, the fight against corruption won an important battle yesterday at the Joburg High Court when the last two of five officials bust for fraud in 2012 at the Tembisa offices were sentenced.Queen Nsindane and Nomfundo Mahlangu were sentenced to 11 and 13 respectively. In 2013, Sandy Goeiman and Thabo Nkumishe took a plea bargain and started their sentences of 14 years, seven years of which were suspended. Charges against one official were withdrawn and she was dismissed. Her appeal was rejected by the CCMA. The fraud relating to the cases amounted to R1,2 million.
