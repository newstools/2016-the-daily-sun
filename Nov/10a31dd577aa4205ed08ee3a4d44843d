WHEN a team of cops from the Hawks kicked down the door of an East London house three months ago, they rescued young women who had been drugged and used as magoshas for the past three years.Tears flowed uncontrollably as the victims of human trafficking and ukuthwala shared their horror stories in a packed hall in Engcobo, Eastern Cape, yesterday.Young women spoke about losing their virginity violently, and being drugged and raped repeatedly.The Trafficking in Person Awareness campaign was led by the Hawks, as well as the NPA and other government departments.A 26-year-old victim, accompanied by her mum, spoke about her pain.&ldquo;Three years ago I met a foreign man at an East London club and he promised me a lot of things, but I began a hell of addiction to drugs,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;I missed home so much but drugs controlled my life. In August this year cops arrived and they saved me and other girls.&ldquo;I was sent to rehab for three months and got TB treatment.&rdquo;Another woman from Engcobo, who also is 26, spoke about how she was abducted when she was only 14 years old.&ldquo;I was on my way from school when I was taken by these men.&ldquo;They carried me as if I was an animal going to slaughter. Within a day I had lost my virginity and started my period,&rdquo; she said.She eventually fled when she was 22 but found that her parents had died.Advocate Nolitha Madiba of the NPA said trafficking and ukuthwala are modern forms of slavery. She said it is illegal to marry a girl under 18.&ldquo;Even if you help to kidnap a girl, you face 15 years in jail and up to life for being a ringleader,&rdquo; she warned.
