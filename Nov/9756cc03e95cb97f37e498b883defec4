NEXT time you think life is tough, take a moment and think of Annah (37) and Sarah Mahosi (35).The two mentally disabled sisters live in a one-room shack. They&rsquo;ve never had jobs, grew up most of their lives without a mother, and have been the target of hurtful insults and even stone-throwing for as long as they can remember.They urgently need SunReaders&rsquo; help.Annah and Sarah are from Ga-Chuene Thogoaneng in Limpopo. They built their one-room shack using their grant money. The child support grant for Sarah&rsquo;s child is now used solely to feed the family of three, but it is never enough. There is no money for clothes or transport, let alone medicine or a burial plan. Their family and community at large have deserted them. But the two sisters do their best to take care of the child.Annah told Daily Sun people from various departments had promised to build them a low-cost house. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve waited more than 10 years and have lost hope. We just live by the word of God, hoping for change.&rdquo; Department of co-operative governance spokesman Khathu Razwiedane said they were not aware of the sisters&rsquo; dire situation and promised to offer them a mobile home while they investigate.
