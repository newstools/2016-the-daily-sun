A &lsquo;FIERCE&rsquo; and &ldquo;robust&rdquo; ANC NEC meeting had to be extended from Sunday to today.One issue was that agreement couldn&rsquo;t be reached on whether or not to hold a secret vote for President Jacob Zuma to step down.&nbsp; Spokesman Zizi Kodwa said the extension was due to a number of items on the agenda which still needed to be discussed.&ldquo;There are a few items on the agenda. This is the last meeting of the year, we have to finish everything,&rdquo; he said.Earlier, City Press reported that Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom had shocked the party when he tabled a motion for a vote for Zuma to step down on Saturday.The decision on the vote was deferred to Sunday but had to again be postponed because the meeting could not reach consensus.Those who attended the meeting described the debate as &ldquo;fierce&rdquo;, &ldquo;heated&rdquo; and &ldquo;robust&rdquo;.It is understood there was a larger number of speakers than usual, speaking for and against Zuma&rsquo;s removal, but that there was still a stalemate.The NEC is the only body with powers to recall the party president in between its conferences. The elective conference is due in 2017.Another NEC member who refused to discuss details confirmed that the meeting had to be extended because &ldquo;they could not finish the robust discussions&rdquo;.The NEC has until now failed to act against Zuma despite growing calls for him to step down from various sectors of society.A source close to News24 confirmed that many of Zuma&rsquo;s backers were not in the NEC meeting on Saturday, but that their numbers had increased on Sunday.It is understood that Zuma's backers are not willing to go down without a fight, with more "fierce" fights expected on Monday.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/anc-extends-its-final-nec-for-2016-20161127
