Police went to his house with him where they discovered ammunition. They asked him where he&rsquo;d got it but he couldn&rsquo;t give the officers proper answers,&rdquo; said Tsotsotso.Upon further questioning, he pointed out his friend. &ldquo;Police searched the house of the second suspect and found a hidden gun.
