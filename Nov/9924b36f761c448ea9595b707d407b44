EFF&rsquo;S Floyd Shivambu has warned Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s backers that one day he might kill them.In a sensational warning, Shivambu during the parliamentary debate on the motion of no confidence against Zuma, compared the president to African dictators who had turned against their comrades.Shivambu described Zuma as a post colonial disaster who has to be removed but said the motion, as tabled to remove him, was a tactical blunder.He urged ANC MPs to create a platform to remove him themselves.&ldquo;One of the common features of these thugs who want to destroy the post-colonial state is to steal for their families. &ldquo;All dictators after stealing government money and fighting opponents will kill their opponents. That&rsquo;s what we are faced with here in South Africa,&rdquo; he said.Speaker after speaker from the opposition benches expressed their support for the motion of no confidence.DA leader Mmusi Maimane urged ANC MPs to vote with their conscience. &ldquo;Today, we can choose corruption or we can choose opportunity for all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We can choose to sit back while our state is captured by the greedy and the corrupt, or we can stand up against state capture.&rdquo; Maimane said the members can choose to elevate Zuma above the law.&ldquo;Or we can fight for every person to be equal before the law,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We can choose to let one man enrich himself, or we can help millions to free themselves from poverty.&rdquo; But ANC debaters on the day, Water Affairs Minister Nomvula Mokonyane and Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba, described the motion as an attempt to humiliate Zuma.Gigaba said the DA knew the motion would not succeed, but had gone ahead with the vote of no confidence to humiliate Zuma and they wanted help to do it.&ldquo;We decline to accept the abuse of the opposition. &ldquo;We will oppose this vote because we cannot join their regime change agendas,&rdquo; said Gigaba.As expected the DA&rsquo;s motion failed.
