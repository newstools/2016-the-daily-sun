FOR MANY people, fun is always very expensive. Eunice Sibiya, head of consumer education at FNB, says while there&rsquo;s nothing wrong having fun, people should spend wisely.&ldquo;Rather than leaving cash in your bank account, use it to make good financial decisions before you are tempted to spend it,&rdquo; she said. She said for many Mzansi people, having fun meant spending and in most cases that landed them in debt. Here are her tricks that can help you save during the festive season.Look after yourself firstMany people get paid early in December and get bonuses too. Send all additional cash to your bond or a savings account. Move it back in January to pay bills. You can also pay off debt, which is always financially helpful.Avoid shopping centres With all the specials and sparkly lights, it is very easy to be lured into overspending. Rather than socialising with friends and family at malls, go to other places like parks, where there is less temptation to spend cash, or spend time in your garden or at the beach. Different kinds of gifts NEVER get into debt for gifts!Presents such as glass jars filled with sweets are fun for kids. Adults appreciate something handmade &ndash; and they also understand how expensive everything is.Be sensible Don&rsquo;t make excuses to spend money just because it&rsquo;s Christmas &ndash; wait until you actually can afford it.
