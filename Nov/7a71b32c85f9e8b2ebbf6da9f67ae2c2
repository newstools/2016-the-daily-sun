ARSENAL have a golden opportunity to kick a self-destructive Uefa Champions League habit when they host Paris St Germain tonight, knowing victory will seal top spot in Group A.The north Londoners have fallen in the Last 16 in each of the past six seasons. During that period they finished first in their initial group only once.Their punishment for finishing runners-up on the other five occasions was harsh, twice being drawn against Bayern Munich and twice against Barcelona, losing all four ties. And even when fortune did favour them, they lost to Monaco.Even if they do beat PSG tonight, who are level on 10 points with the Gunners, the spectre of a horror draw against Bayern or Barcelona would still exist.Neither of those two clubs are guaranteed top spot in their respective sections and could lurk as runners-up, but unless Arsene Wenger owns a crystal ball he can only assume that finishing top will be rewarded.Ultimately, luck of the draw will play its part but an Arsenal victory would maintain the positive vibe of their campaign to date and send a message to their rivals.Olivier Giroud&rsquo;s late equaliser against Manchester United on Saturday means Arsenal are unbeaten in 17 matches in all competition since losing to Liverpool on the opening day of the season. PSG are on a nine-game undefeated run.Arsenal have drawn three of their last four Premier League games and should tonight&rsquo;s match end all square, the battle for top spot will go down to the final round of games when Arsenal travel to Basel and PSG host Ludogorets.While Arsenal&rsquo;s level has dipped in recent weeks, Wenger believes their resilience will be key against PSG. &ldquo;Hopefully we can move on with some wins. We have a big game against Paris Saint-Germain and that will be the same intensity,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am convinced we will be better.&rdquo;PSG warmed up with a 2-0 defeat of Nantes at the weekend but suffered an injury scare when Angel Di Maria was withdrawn in the first half because of a hamstring niggle. Coach Unai Emery later said he was confident the Argentine winger would be fit to face Arsenal. Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer has been ruled out of Bayern&rsquo;s trip to Russia to face Rostov in the Champions League tonight, the German champions said. &ndash; REUTERS
