FROGS and tarantulas are not usually the best of friends . . .Either the frog eats the spider, or the other way around!But scientists have discovered that certain types of burrowing tarantulas have mutually beneficial relationships with narrow-mouthed frog species. Although quite capable of eating these frogs, tarantulas choose to keep them as &ldquo;pets&rdquo;. The spider defends the frog against other predators, while the frog eats the ants that commonly prey on spider eggs. This behaviour has now been seen among spiders and frogs in South America and Asia.
