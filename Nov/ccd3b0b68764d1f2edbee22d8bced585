SUPERSPORT United head coach Stuart Baxter has told his players to enjoy the moment but warned them that from today they must keep their feet firmly on the ground.Baxter and his players were in seventh heaven after Matsatsantsa a Pitori destroyed previously unbeaten Orlando Pirates 6-1 in their Absa Premiership clash at Nelspruit&rsquo;s Mbombela Stadium on Tuesday.But the focus has shifted to Mamelodi Sundowns, the reigning PSL and African champions. The two teams meet in a Tshwane Telkom Knockout derby at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday (6pm).&ldquo;That second-half display against Pirates rivals any performance I've seen since I became involved in South Africa, and I&rsquo;ve been in some classic matches with Kaizer Chiefs,&rdquo; said Baxter. &ldquo;This was a really brilliant display against a top side like Pirates.&rdquo;Baxter&rsquo;s lads looked like championship material as they tore Pirates to pieces: &ldquo;People are talking about us winning the league but there is a long way to go. If we can keep this momentum going, anything is possible. We need to continue with this type of performance. But first we have to play the African champions, Sundowns.&rdquo;Baxter said if both Tshwane rivals brought their A-game fans would be in for a treat: &ldquo;Sundowns looked a bit fatigued (when they lost 2-1 to Cape Town City) but that is only to be expected after their heroics in winning the Champions League. This Tshwane derby could be another crowd-pleaser.&rdquo;Baxter stressed, however, that while his players did brilliantly to score six goals against the Buccaneers after trailing 1-0 at the break, they couldn&rsquo;t afford to rest on their laurels.He said: &ldquo;I made a couple of tactical changes at half-time and they worked to perfection. But now that we have shown how good we can play, we need to maintain this standard.&ldquo;This win has been a massive boost to the players&rsquo; confidence but we still have that Knockout quarterfinal against our city rivals. We have to come back to earth quickly and show we are up for this new challenge too.&rdquo;
