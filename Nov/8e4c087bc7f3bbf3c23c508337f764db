MANAGERS at Rand Water in Odi were horrified when striking workers threw kak around their offices on Monday and smeared it on their cars! Municipal water and sanitation workers, together with residents of Ga-Rankuwa and Mabopane in Tshwane, blocked the entrance with big stones. The workers demanded permanent jobs while residents said they were sick of blocked drains and broken meters at their homes. Zweledinga Mdingi (40) said he had been doing the same job for 40 years but was still not a permanent employee. &ldquo;We have to work with human kak, which is a serious health hazard, but we are not recognised,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Some of the things we deal with are traumatising. Sometimes we find babies in the drains, but we do not even have medical aid.&rdquo; Resident Phillip Letlape (45) said even when the broken meters and blocked drains were fixed, they break down again within a few days. Some of the workers arrived at the offices with a bakkie loaded with buckets of sewage which they poured into managers&rsquo; offices as well as over cars. One of the workers, Jefty Mosuwe (47), even started smearing sewage over his own upper body.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better if I smell like kak because that is how they treat me,&rdquo; he said. Workers&rsquo; spokesman Wanda Mnguni said they would not return to work until they were given what they deserved. City of Tshwane spokesman Lindela Mashigo said the workers were employed by a service provider. &ldquo;No one is entitled to a post. The municipality has a business relationship with a service provider called Big Eye and will talk to the company.&rdquo;
