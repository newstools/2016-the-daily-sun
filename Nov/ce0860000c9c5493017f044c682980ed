Bloemfontein Celtic have announced that they have released defender Cheslyn Jampies from the squad, after he was found guilty of breaching the club's code of conduct.The 25-year-old joined Siwelele from Jomo Cosmos earlier this year, but struggled to cement himself in the first-team, having featured just once for Celtic this season.The former Santos man appeared before a disciplinary hearing, where he was found guilty of violating the club's rules in an incident that reportedly took place early in November.In a statement drafted by the club, club CEO Khumbuani Konco admitted that the club are sad to lose the services of the one-time Bafana Bafana international."We have a rule book that is given to each player when they join the team and all players are expected to use it as a guideline," he told the club's website."We expect our players to be professional on and off the field considering that they represent a brand that is backed by sponsors and supporters."We are sad to release Cheslyn but the rules have to be followed as a sign of respect to the club (badge) and teammates."The club also took the time to reveal that shot-stopper Patrick Tignyemb has been handed a written warning and a fine for intimidation and harassment.
