And now he is living in fear as both men returned on Friday &ndash; armed with knives!Alfred Mudau (56) calls his pub &ldquo;the kasi&rsquo;s best tavern&rdquo; where many people come to chill and enjoy their drinks.But the place is not short of thugs who come to rob his customers, or troublemakers who disturb the peaceful atmosphere.On Friday, two thugs came to get their revenge. &ldquo;They told me I was wrong to chase them away last week when they fought with one of their girlfriends. They grabbed me and wanted to stab me.&rdquo; Alfred said he overpowered the men, hit one with a brick and locked himself inside the house. &ldquo;The angry men started hitting the doors with stones and insulting us. They later stabbed my car tyres, smashed the windscreen and stole my car radio.&ldquo;It pains me because all I do is run my business and protect the people who support me.&ldquo;I cannot allow thugs to terrorise my customers every weekend and sit back.&rdquo; He said the Friday incident was not the first. In April, thugs hit him on the head with a brick while he was busy braaing chicken for his customers.&ldquo;I fell down and lost a lot of blood.&rdquo; He said he recognised the suspects and they were arrested. &ldquo;I am still attending court for the April incident and now other thugs came on Friday. I don&rsquo;t know why I am a target.&rdquo; Captain Hitler Ngwenya, Meadowlands Police Station spokesman, confirmed that they are investigating a case of malicious damage to property.
