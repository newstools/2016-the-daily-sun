AMERICANS have taken to social media with stories of racist attacks that have allegedly taken place following the election of Donald Trump as the next US president.Trump's campaign had heavily focused on minorities and foreigners, including Muslims and Mexicans, as he painted the two groups as threats to peace and the economy.Famously, Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the US during his campaign. He also promised to build a wall to block Mexicans from entering the country.Rights groups have said they are concerned over the future. Many believe the election of Trump, a former reality TV star who was endorsed by far-right groups and politicians, might legitimise outward racism and physical violence.The Council on American-Islamic-Relations (CAIR), America's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organisation, on Thursday called on Trump to "repudiate alleged attacks on Muslim students at universities in Louisiana and California reportedly by some of his supporters".Human Rights Watch said Trump should "abandon campaign rhetoric that seemed to reject many of the United States&rsquo; core human rights obligations"."He found a path to the White House through a campaign marked by misogyny (hatred of women), racism, and xenophobia, but that&rsquo;s not a route to successful governance. President-elect Trump should commit to leading the US in a manner that fully respects and promotes human rights for everyone," said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. http://www.news24.com/World/News/reports-of-racist-attacks-rise-after-donald-trumps-win-20161111
