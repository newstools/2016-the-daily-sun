KAIZER&nbsp;Chiefs head coach Steve&nbsp;Komphela&nbsp;reckons his side conceded two easy goals during their&nbsp;Absa&nbsp;Premiership&nbsp; game against&nbsp;Mamelodi&nbsp;Sundowns&nbsp;at Loftus&nbsp;Versfeld&nbsp;Stadium yesterday.Sundowns&nbsp;came from behind to beat Chiefs 2-1 to register their first home victory in the league this season.Amakhosi&nbsp;broke the ice through&nbsp;Ramahlwe&nbsp;Mphahlele&nbsp;but they were unable to defend the lead as&nbsp;Sundowns&nbsp;took the opportunity on a break to equalise.Komphela, who was a defender during his playing times says Downs two goals&nbsp;were scored&nbsp;because of the mistakes made from the back.He said: "The goals scored by&nbsp;Sundowns&nbsp;for me I thought we gave away two cheap goals. Both of them came from our errors of mistakes."But a game of football is that goals&nbsp;are scored&nbsp;from mistakes. They were just too cheap. The first goal came from a break at a crucial time. We just scored and we were hoping that will manage the game well but when&nbsp;Sibusiso&nbsp;Khumalowent down, we were one man down and there was a bit of commotion and we failed to deal with a run from&nbsp;TebogoLangerman&nbsp;then the score was level in no time.Komphela&nbsp;added: " The second goal as well we failed to cut&nbsp; the ball by the benches and directly they went on a break attack and obviously we conceded and after that you know you will struggle."In the second half I think we were not that good but first half was&nbsp;better.It was Chiefs' second successive loss following their elimination in the quarterfinals of the&nbsp;Telkom&nbsp;Knockout by Free State Stars two weeks ago.Komphela&nbsp;charges are facing&nbsp;SuperSport&nbsp;United on Wednesday night (7:30) in a league game.United also dropped points after playing to a 1-all draw with PSL rookies&nbsp;Baroka&nbsp;FC on Saturday.However, Chiefs will know that it will be a difficult encounter considering that United hammered Orlando Pirates 6-1 the last time they played.&nbsp;
