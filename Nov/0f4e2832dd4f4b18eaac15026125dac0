The Economic Freedom Fighters argued in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria on Tuesday that the release of former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's "state capture" report is in the public's interest. EFF advocate Thembeka Ngcukaitobi said President Jacob Zuma's application to postpone the court hearing on the applications to interdict the release of the report was invalid. He said Zuma had agreed with all parties involved in the case to have his as well as Co-operative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen's case consolidated.He said there was a constitutional obligation that, once finalised, the Public Protector's report should be released to the public.He told the court the EFF was surprised by Zuma's announcement that he sought a postponement on the case. "In a case as important as this, the court should not be detained," Ngcukaitobi added.Advocate Dali Mpofu for the United Democratic Movement and Cope argued that opposition parties had interest in the matter because it was up to them to make a decision following the conclusion of the report.Madonsela investigated allegations that Zuma's friends, the Gupta family, offered government officials Cabinet posts in exchange for government tenders and other favours. The family has denied the allegations.Madonsela was due to release the report on October 14, the last day of her seven-year term. Zuma and Van Rooyen, however, went to the High Court to ask for an interdict to stop her from doing so.Van Rooyen withdrew his application, only to apply for it again later.Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane has also applied to interdict the release of the report.
