THE new council of Jozini Municipality in northern KZN is determined to get rid of all corrupt officials. The municipality was placed under administration by the KZN department of co-operative governance and traditional affairs last year and is working hard to revive its image.The municipality managed to stop 50 ghost workers&rsquo; salaries after the municipality&rsquo;s audited books were subjected to an external investigation by new mayor Delani Mabika.He told Daily Sun that a municipal official handed in his resignation letter on Monday after she was bust for receiving 23 of the ghost workers&rsquo; payments amounting to R63 000. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t allow the official to get off the hook that easily,&rdquo; said Mabika. He said processes will be followed before further action is taken.&ldquo;This is just the beginning. More officials will be investigated,&rdquo; Mabika said.
