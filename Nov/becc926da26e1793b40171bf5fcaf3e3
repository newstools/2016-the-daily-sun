INKOSI Bhekizizwe Luthuli is unhappy about what he calls &ldquo;dirty cops&rdquo;.Luthuli was speaking at a visit by community safety and liaison MEC Mxolisi Kaunda to Mthwalume on Saturday. In 2014, activist Sbu Mhlongo had already led a community march to complain that cops were working with thugs and wanted cops to be removed or the cop shop to be closed.Kaunda met residents at Nkanini sports field after they wrote to his office about the many street kids who are whoonga addicts, known as amaphara.They claimed cops are working with thugs to sell whoonga.Luthuli said the area has become a playground for thugs. &ldquo;People have to use sofas to keep the amaphara out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Whoonga nests are all over Turton and Hibberdene taxi ranks.&rdquo; He said some criminals are caught but their cases are not recorded in cops&rsquo; record books. &ldquo;Sometimes you come to report crime and the cops tell you they can&rsquo;t open a docket.&rdquo; Kaunda encouraged residents to work with cops. He said dirty cops have no place in his department. He added they will also train community leaders to fight crime. &ldquo;The dirty cops should start packing their bags now. If the people are crying it means there is something wrong,&rdquo; he said.Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: &ldquo;We urge those who have information to come forward. Contact the cluster commander or call 08600 10111.&rdquo;
