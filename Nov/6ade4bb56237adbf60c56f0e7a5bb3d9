THE fires of unrest that destroyed schools across Vuwani and prompted a stayaway at local elections in August appear to still be smouldering.The pro-Makhado municipal task force which opposed the merger of Hlanganani, Vuwani and Malamulele into the new Collins Chabane Municipality maintain that nothing has changed. They said activism is merely on hold to allow children to write exams.Pro-Makhado task team spokesman Nsovo Sambo said they are stronger than before. He said they are waiting for children to finish exams before they begin a total shutdown.&ldquo;We have agreed as the community that we want to give our children the opportunity to write exams, and then we will start the total shutdown. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to fall under the Malamulele Municipality. We are fine under Makhado Municipality because we receive service delivery and we are satisfied with it,&rdquo; Nsovo said. &ldquo;We were not consulted about the merger and were surprised when we were told we would fall under Malamulele.&rdquo;Since the political unrest in Vuwani, 29 schools and government infrastructure worth about R500 million has been burned or destroyed. Twenty-nine people who were believed to be behind the arson and malicious damage campaign were arrested and later released on bail. This includes former Makhado Councillor Gideon Chavuya. &ndash; AENS
