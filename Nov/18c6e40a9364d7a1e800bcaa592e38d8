MERCILESS, cruel, cold, humiliating and inhumane!These words described the evil couple who were yesterday sentenced to life in prison for killing their daughter, Neo Telekwa (4).&ldquo;Home is where you find hope. But for little Neo it was despair, fear and doom,&rdquo; said prosecutor Arveena Persad about Pearl Telekwa (26) and her lover Charles Monare (31). They killed Neo in their shack in Rockville, Soweto in August 2013.Acting Judge Isabel Mlaba yesterday sentenced the couple to a further 10 years in jail.Monare, who was Neo&rsquo;s stepfather, was also given 21 years for two counts of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and one of assault. All the sentences will run concurrently with their life imprisonment.Mlaba said the offences were very serious. She said Monare beat the toddler as if he was fighting with another man and that he did so for more than a year. On the day Neo died, Monare hit her with his fists and bashed her against rocks.Telekwa was not present on the day, however she agreed with her boyfriend to cover up the child&rsquo;s death. They planned to bury her in the veld and later report her missing. Luckily, a neighbour heard Neo&rsquo;s screams and called the police. She was found lying face down on the floor.Mlaba blamed the mother for not protecting her own child.&ldquo;Even on the last day when she was lying in bed with a black eye and asking for a glass of water, you ignored her,&rdquo; said Mlaba to Telekwa. Persad told the court that Monare had said to Telekwa: &ldquo;Let that dog die.&rdquo;
