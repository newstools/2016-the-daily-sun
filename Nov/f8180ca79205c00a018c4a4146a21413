A TRAUMATISED man&rsquo;s alleged tiny 4-5 has been causing him a huge headache for a long time.It&rsquo;s all because his former lover will not stop telling everyone he has a finger-sized penis!The man (38) told Daily Sun that whenever his ex sees him in public she lies about his shortcomings between the sheets.&ldquo;My ex-girlfriend has made my life miserable,&rdquo; the man from Khayelitsha in Uitenhage, Nelson Mandela Bay, told the People&rsquo;s Paper, adding he was forced to avoid places where his 30-year-old ex goes.&ldquo;Everywhere I go, this wicked woman is always lurking, hurling her bad remarks in my face. She insults me in public, that I have a small 4-5 and that I can&rsquo;t poke! It&rsquo;s been this way since 2007 when I broke up with her.&rdquo;He said he has all but lost his dignity in his community as other women believe his ex&rsquo;s hurtful insults.&ldquo;She hates it that I do not give her any attention.&ldquo;I think she feels I owe her money. &ldquo;I was unemployed when we dated and when I tell her I don&rsquo;t have money to give to her, she starts shouting about my failures in bed.&ldquo;I have approached other women who have shunned my advances, telling me they have already heard of my short CV! &ldquo;I do not deserve this.&ldquo;This thing haunts me and it has killed my self-esteem.&rdquo;The former lover told Daily Sun she will not stop insulting the man as long as he lives.&ldquo;He always walks with a different woman to the shisa nyamas, but he never did that for me. &ldquo;I will continue to insult him. I am not lying about his 4-5. Even my 11-year-old son&rsquo;s is bigger than his!&rdquo;Asked why he hadn&rsquo;t opened a case against the woman, the man said he feared victimisation. &ldquo;Obviously, they will turn it into a joke,&rdquo; he said.Captain Gerda Swart said she would approach the police&rsquo;s legal services for advice. &ldquo;This is a breach of human rights,&rdquo; she said.
