STRONG winds have left two residents of Vezubuhle New Settlement homeless.Dick Mokoena (58) from Vezubuhle in Kwa-Mhlanga said the incident happened on Wednesday night while he was sitting in his chair enjoying the fresh air. He said he suddenly heard a noise. &ldquo;I thought someone was trying to break in,&rdquo; he said.He called for his neighbour, Andrew Lodi (40), but he did not respond.&ldquo;I stood up and when I got to the door the strong wind lifted my shack,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I was in my right state of mind because Andrew told me I followed the shack as it was being pulled away by the wind,&rdquo; he said.Dick said his neighbour told him his head was nearly taken off by one of the iron sheets during the chaos. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even remember how I got out of the shack,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for my caring neighbour I don&rsquo;t think I would be alive today,&rdquo; he said.He said all his food, which usually lasts him for the whole month, was ruined by the rain.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure how I&rsquo;m going to survive until month end because I already spent my entire pension on groceries,&rdquo; he said.Andrew said when he heard the wind was getting stronger he went outside.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I was able to save my neighbour,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Dick said he called for my help but I didn&rsquo;t hear him. &ldquo;But when I saw his shack being blown away I ran towards him and by God&rsquo;s grace I got to him on time,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;In the morning we could not find some of our clothes because they were stolen by thugs in the night,&rdquo; he said.
