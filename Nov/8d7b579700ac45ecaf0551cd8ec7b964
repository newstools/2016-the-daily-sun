RESIDENTS of Ekurhuleni should brace themselves for a filthy weekend.This is after the Ekurhuleni&rsquo;s Clean City project workers downed tools yesterday, crying foul over the early termination of their contracts.The workers marched to the Germiston Civic Centre on Wednesday to show their anger . They were met by police and metro officials before they could enter the building.The angry workers claimed they had been told their contracts would be terminated next month, but that their contracts stated they would be employed until June.One of the workers, Mojalefa Tseku from Springs, said the municipality was taking them for a ride.&ldquo;They told us that our contracts would be terminated in December but our contracts only end in June.&ldquo;These people must not play with us. They can&rsquo;t just hire and fire any way they want,&rdquo; said Tseku.More than 1 000 workers protested and vowed they won&rsquo;t return to work until their grievances are addressed.EFF Gauteng organiser Khethisa Khabo said they supported the workers.&ldquo;How do you fight unemployment when you lay people off their jobs? Their contracts state that they&rsquo;ll be employed until June, not December,&rdquo; said &shy;Khabo.Spokesman Zweli Dlamini said they received the workers&rsquo; memorandum of grievances. &ldquo;We have organised a meeting with their leadership, which will take place next week,&rdquo; said Dlamini.
