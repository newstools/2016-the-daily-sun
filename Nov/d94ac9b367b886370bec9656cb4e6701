A SHEMBE scam using the church&rsquo;s late leader&rsquo;s face has surfaced on social media.The Nazareth Baptist Church, popularly known as Shembe, has distanced itself from the fraudulent money-making scheme.The photo circulating on Facebook shows the face of the church&rsquo;s late leader, Johannes Shembe, with worshippers dressed in white below him.On the photo is written: &ldquo;Nikela ku Shembe, bese ulinda izinsuku ezintathu. Nikelela umsebenzi, isifo, umshado. SMS Shembe ku 49727. I&ndash;SMS iyinye ngu R30. Amen.&rdquo; It means: &ldquo;Pay your offering to Shembe, and then wait for three days. Pay your offering for jobs, sickness, marriage. SMS Shembe to 49727. Each SMS costs R30.&rdquo;Spokesmen for the two main Shembe factions said the church doesn&rsquo;t operate through social media.Thokozani Mncwabe from the eBuhleni faction, led by Mduduzi Shembe, said they were shocked by the photo.&ldquo;These opportunists tarnish the image of our church. This is not how we operate. People with problems go straight to our leader. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t tell them what to offer. They give according to what they can afford, even if it&rsquo;s just 50c or R1,&rdquo; said Mncwabe.He urged the faithful not to fall for the scheme and said a church committee would meet to discuss the matter.&ldquo;We urge people to come directly to our leader when they have problems, or they can go to our temples where they can present their problems to our pastors.&rdquo; Nkululeko Mthethwa from the Thembezinhle faction, led by Vela Shembe, said they haven&rsquo;t heard anything about the matter.
