YET another pastor&rsquo;s strange actions have surfaced in a video.This is after videos of Prophet Lethebo Rabalago spraying Doom in the faces of congregants went viral this week. Now another pastor from Hammanskraal, Tshwane has released a video showing him commanding a church member to touch a live wire. On Sunday, Apostle Phillip Sithole (25), known as Hephzibah, also claimed to turn water into wine. He said he was doing the same thing Jesus did when the wine ran out at a wedding.He allegedly asked a man to drink the wine and he instantly got drunk. Rabalago is the son of Pastor Lesego Daniel, while Hephizbah was reportedly also trained by him. Daniel made headlines across the country in 2014 when he ordered his congregation to eat grass. Hephzibah, who is the pastor of Divine Word Ministries, told Daily Sun God gave him a pure anointing. &ldquo;I can command people to touch live wires and they will not get electrocuted. Anointing is more powerful than live wires,&rdquo; he claimed. He said after he had anointed people, they could do anything without putting themselves in danger. &ldquo;Not everyone can do this. It&rsquo;s only for those who have the power of God.&rdquo; A church member said the congregation was worried by Sunday&rsquo;s events. &ldquo;Not everyone is happy with the way the pastor does things. This might be bad for the church&rsquo;s reputation. And we are worried people might get hurt.&rdquo; Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva, chairwoman of the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultura, Religious and Linguistic Communities, said they urged the religious sector to register all the pastors and prophets in South Africa.&ldquo;Through such an organisation there will be laws that pastors and prophets must obey. Those doing illegal things in the name of religion will be dealt with.&rdquo;
