HIGHLANDS Park have yet to record a victory in the league with Gordon Igesund at the helm.Golden Arrows coach Clinton Larsen triumphed over his former mentor when Arrows narrowly edged Highlands 1-0 in an Absa Premiership match played at Makhulong Stadium yesterday. It was Igesund&rsquo;s third league match in charge, having drawn 2-2 with Free State Stars and 1-1 with Maritzburg United previously. Larsen played under the former SuperSport United and Bafana Bafana coach at Manning Rangers and Orlando Pirates a decade ago. He went on to claim two titles with Igesund.The first half produced no goals but kept Arrows goalkeeper Maximilian Mbaeva busy, who had to come to his team&rsquo;s rescue and prevent them from conceding while Tapuwa Kapini was on holiday.However, Arrows came into the second half guns blazing, looking to get an opener as early as the first minute of the second half, but Lerato Lamola shot wide in a one-on-one situation.Eventually the visitors were able to break the ice with only a few minutes left before stoppage time when Danny Phiri&rsquo;s chip went in to give Arrows the lead.Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende are now in second place with 17 points from nine games. Bidvest Wits are still in first place with 19 points from seven games.The Lions of the North tried their utmost to bounce back and snatch a point in the dying minutes but it was too little too late for them. Larsen&rsquo;s charges will hope they take the momentum into their next match when they play Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Versfeld Stadium on Wednesday (7:30).In other results, Bloemfontein Celtic played to a goalless draw with Polokwane City at Dr Molemela Stadium.
