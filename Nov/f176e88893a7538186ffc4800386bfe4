GOLDEN Arrows head coach Clinton Larsen reckons using speedy players against Mamelodi Sundowns is the way to approach tonight&rsquo;s Absa Premiership clash against them at Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria (7.30pm). Both teams go into this match high in energy after winning their respective matches over the weekend. Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende beat Highlands Park 1-0 away and Bafana ba Style won at home, beating Kaizer Chiefs 2-1.Larsen claims to have identified Sundowns&rsquo; weakness and plans to use that to his advantage. He explains: &ldquo;Tall players are seldom quick. Sundowns have a lot of those, especially at the back. If we use our speed correctly we will definitely come away with something in this match.&rdquo; Larsen warned his players to tread carefully and not to underestimate their opponents. He said his players would have to keep in mind that they were not playing a random team but the African Champions. &ldquo;They are not African Champions for nothing,&rdquo; warned Larsen. &ldquo;They are organised and a quality team. I&rsquo;ve been reminding my players that we will be facing a team that have conquered Africa. Who are we to come and underestimate them? We&rsquo;re a small team from Lamontville, so we must show them the respect they deserve.&rdquo; These two teams have met 25 times before in all competitions and Sundowns have dominated their encounters, beating Arrows 12 times. Arrows have won just seven and drew six times. Ahead of tonight&rsquo;s encounter, Larsen said he was happy with the underdogs tag: &ldquo;All we need to do is to make sure we are organised when we play them. We need to be at our best throughout the match.&rdquo;Last season Arrows got the better of Sundowns in the league, winning 2-1 in the first round and drawing their match in the second round.
