ANGRY women outside the Germiston Magistrates Court in Ekurhuleni said they have had enough of women and children being abused and murdered.A 38-year-old man was applying for bail after a woman and child were killed at Makause squatter camp in Primrose, Ekurhuleni on Wednesday.Community leader Jomo Ngwenya said: &ldquo;I heard shots being fired just two streets away from me in broad daylight. Luckily, a police van had just passed by and I managed to alert cops.&rdquo; Jomo said when they got to the shack, they found women crying. &ldquo;When we went into the yard, we saw the body of a six-year-old girl lying by the door. She had been shot three times. As we went inside, we found her mum&rsquo;s body. She had been shot six times.&rdquo;Jomo told Daily Sun the man fled the scene and no one saw where he went. A traumatised neighbour said the man was angry because his wife was due to start work on Thursday and he claimed she would start cheating. &ldquo;He has been aggressive since his wife told him she had a job. &ldquo;He told her not to take the job,&rdquo; said the neighbour.Mandla Nkabinde from the office of the councillor said these crimes were becoming common in their community. &ldquo;Women and children are no longer safe in the hands of men they trust.&rdquo; He said the family is struggling to organise the funeral and any help would be appreciated.Police spokesman Sergeant Styles Maome said the man handed himself over to the police the same night that he shot his family. &ldquo;He came to the station with his licensed firearm and confessed to his crime. He was charged with murder and is being kept in police custody.&rdquo;
