But Eunice Rambuwani is nowhere to be found.Her husband doesn&rsquo;t know whether she is still alive or not.She was abducted from her house in Winterveld, north of Tshwane, in the early hours of Tuesday morning.According to her husband, Tshidiso Molefe (32), they were asleep with their four-year-old daughter when he was woken up by a bright light. He said he thought it was his wife who had switched on the light to go to the bathroom.But when he looked up, he saw that it was cellphone flashlights held by two men who were pointing guns at his head. &ldquo;The third one was standing next to my bedroom door and he ordered the two to tie me up,&rdquo; he said. Tshidiso said the men were speaking in isiZulu.&ldquo;They asked me where the money was and I told them it was in the lounge on the TV stand.&rdquo;He said he had more than R6 000 which he was going to use to stock up with vegetables and fruit as he is a hawker.But the men took it and demanded more money from him. When he said he didn&rsquo;t have any more money, they hit him on the head with a gun.&ldquo;Then they asked my wife if we had any more money in the house. &ldquo;When she told them we did not, the one standing by the door told my wife to open her legs,&rdquo; he said. Tshidiso said one of the robbers asked his friend to leave his wife alone.But the man grabbed Eunice by the hand and left with her.
