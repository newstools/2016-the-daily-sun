Dear Pastor Since my mum died last year, I have lost my faith. I have prayed and attended a number of churches in the hope of having my faith restored. I matriculated with good marks last year, but I was not able to go to university. It feels like I fail at everything I try. I am too discouraged to do the things I know I should.It feels as if I have no place in the world. Pastor, I need you to pray with me. Please help restore my faith.
