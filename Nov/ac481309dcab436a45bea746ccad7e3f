Twenty-two high school pupils and three adults were taken to hospital in Vereeniging, Gauteng, after a swarm of bees attacked them on Thursday morning. ER24 spokesperson Chitra Bodasing Harduth said a beehive was disturbed at the school while maintenance workers were apparently cutting grass."All patients are in a stable condition at this stage," she said."There are instances where you cannot foresee bee attacks. General advice to the public would be not to provoke bees or interfere with bee hives. Seek professional assistance." http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/22-high-schoolers-hospitalised-after-bee-attack-20161117
