TV PRESENTER K Naomi and stylist Tshepi Vundla&rsquo;s friendship was put to the ultimate test. This after the two besties allegedly found themselves locked in a catfight over a married man, Mzansi&rsquo;s top rapper Shugasmakx, at a Jozi upmarket club, Taboo! Sunday Sun sources alleged the two slugged it out in full view of club patrons. &ldquo;Believe it or not, they were fighting over rapper Shugasmakx,&rdquo; claimed a source. According to another source, Shugasmakx, K Naomi and Tshepi had been partying all day. &ldquo;They started at DJ Miss Cosmos&rsquo;s fun house in Sandton, then went to a Woolies party and ended up at Taboo,&rdquo; the source said. A witness, who asked not to be named, said all hell broke loose when one girl accused the other of flirting with Shugasmakx. &ldquo;We saw people pushing each other in the VIP section. They tried to protect their faces and It turned out the commotion was caused by Tshepi and K Naomi,&rdquo; the source claimed. The witness said the two ladies were separated by club patrons, and added: &ldquo;We were confused, as Shugasmakx is a married man.&rdquo; According to the source, one of the friends yelled: &ldquo;This b*tch has been looking at my man throughout the evening.&rdquo; Tshepi tweeted: You can&rsquo;t trust anyone. The witness said the two besties are no longer on speaking terms. Tshepi said the rumours are untrue. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s incorrect. Check with your sources,&rdquo; she said before she hung up. Shugasmakx laughed the claims off, and said: the allegations. He was not aware the two ladies fought. &ldquo;What? Never! I don&rsquo;t have a clue they fought.&rdquo; Asked if he&rsquo;s dating either of the girls, Shugasmakx said there&rsquo;s no chance. K Noami couldn&rsquo;t be reached for comment.
