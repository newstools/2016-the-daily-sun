ERNEST Mdunge (49) may be partially blind, but it&rsquo;s clear to him that his rights are being violated. He said a construction company demolished his mud house and built him a sub-standard RDP.After the RDP failed the building inspection, it was knocked down. Now Ernest and his mentally ill sister were left in the cold. Ernest from Elandskop in Pietermaritzburg, KZN Midlands, said life was better before his mud house was demolished.He told Daily Sun that the RDP was built in 2013 but when the inspectors came in 2014, they found it built below standard and demolished it. &ldquo;I waited for the construction company to come back but they didn&rsquo;t. I then built a one-roomed house using home-made mud bricks and bricks from the failed house to have a shelter over my head,&rdquo; said Ernest. He added life was difficult living in the small space with his mentally ill sister.They both feared that it could fall at any moment as Ernest could bump into the walls because his vision isn&rsquo;t clear.&ldquo;We get wet when it rains as water passes through the spaces between the blocks. Everything inside gets wet. &ldquo;All I want is a decent house for me and my sister.&rdquo; Councillor Thandiwe Madondo said she was aware of the issue and was trying to find help for Ernest.Construction company Vulindlela Development association senior manager, Bhoyo Kunene, promised to check their database and establish which site the house fell under. &ldquo;We will then investigate the matter and establish facts,&rdquo; said Kunene.
