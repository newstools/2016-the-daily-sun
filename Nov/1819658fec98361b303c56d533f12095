THE taxi patrol car was cruising the streets on Friday, looking for taxi drivers taking a chance and scoring on streets where they were not supposed to be. The occupants of the blue Nissan Cressida patrol car spotted an errant driver and gave chase &ndash; but it ended in tragedy. The speeding car first killed a pedestrian before crashing into a concrete streetlight base, killing three and injuring two. The passengers of the car were flung out and lay scattered on the busy Molefe Makinta Highway between Mabopane and Ga-Rankuwa, north of Tshwane. Witness Mpho Mohloki (45) said the car was speeding and lost control. He said the car first hit a woman on the side of the road before crashing into the big cement block at the base of the street light on the divide between the busy highway lanes. &ldquo; I heard a loud bang and when I looked I saw people flying from the car,&rdquo; he said. Mp ho added that it was tragic that the woman lost her life. She was a local woman who was selling cosmetics to residents of Hebron. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy for me to close my eyes at ni ght. I still have flashbacks about the accident,&rdquo; said Mpho. Former chairman o f the Hebron Taxi Organisation, Roy Tho bedi, said it came as a shock to them. &ldquo;We are in partnership with the patrol group but we don&rsquo;t know what they were doing on this side . It was supposed to operate on the Brits side,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve lost peopl e who were supposed to look after our drivers.&rdquo; Roy claimed patrol services were very important at this time of the year as drivers tend to ta k e more chances and use roads they were not supposed to operate on. North West cop spokeswoman Sergeant Kelebogile Moleko confirmed that a case of culpable homicide was opened for investigation .
