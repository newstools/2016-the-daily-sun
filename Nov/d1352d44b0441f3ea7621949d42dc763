KZN safety MEC Mxolisi Kaunda is disappointed that most taxis in Pinetown are not roadworthy. On Sunday, as part of commemorating the World Day of Remembrance, Kaunda decided to set up a roadblock on the M13 Fields Hill Road in Pinetown, west of Durban. This is the spot where a tragic crash involving four taxis and a truck took place recently.The crash claimed 27 lives and left 80 people hurt. Kaunda laid a wreath on the spot. The day was dedicated to remembering the millions of people who were killed, injured and affected by road crashes. Kaunda said he was not happy to learn that people are still putting their lives at risk by using unroadworthy taxis. This was after he stopped a taxi and found an empty crate being used as a seat. A mum and a toddler were sitting on it. Kaunda said: &ldquo;This is totally unacceptable! As passengers, you should complain about such things at your ranks or dial our mpimpa hotline to report them. &ldquo;Your lives are very important. You must always use roadworthy taxis.&rdquo; The MEC urged everyone who uses the roads to be responsible and arrive alive. Phillip Taaibosch, president of the South African National Taxi Council, apologised to families who have lost their breadwinners and kids as a results of taxi accidents.
