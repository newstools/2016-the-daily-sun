SOME roads of Mayville in Durban are left with heaps of smelly rubbish. That&rsquo;s because residents allegedly stopped the company that collects rubbish from entering the area.The residents demanded that the company should hire local people or ship out.Muthwa Construction Company has been collecting waste in the area for two years. But since Friday the company has not been able to make their weekly collections in some parts of Mayville. Resident Mlungisi Duma (35) said:&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve tried to resolve the companies hiring policy with them in a polite manner but they&rsquo;re not willing to listen to us. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for them to pay attention. They will see how serious we are about this issue.&rdquo;Another resident Kwenza Mdadane (47) said they are waiting to meet their ward councillor to address their concerns.He said they&rsquo;re not going to back down from their decision to stop the company from operating. &ldquo;Either they hire locals or they leave. We will continue to stop their operation if they don&rsquo;t act on our concerns. There are lots of unemployed people in this area who need jobs.&rdquo;Ward Councillor Mveli Mthembu said he will meet with the residents some time this week to try and find a solution to the matter.Daily Sun contacted Muthwa Construction where the receptionist said: &ldquo;The owner of the company, Baphiwe Muthwa, is not allowed to speak to the media about the matter.&rdquo;
