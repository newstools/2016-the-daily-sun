THE people of Joburg deserve better than mayor Herman Mashaba. This was what the ANC greater Joburg region said at their offices yesterday.They accused the DA municipality of cancelling programmes that benefit the poor majority. Joburg party treasurer Geoffrey Makhubo said: &ldquo;The cancellation of the local bakeries project by Mashaba is the worst decision in the history of local economic development.&rdquo;He said the decision was just a taste of what the DA had in store for the city in the coming years. Makhubo and his colleagues, Jolidee Mantongo, Constance Bapela and Dada Morero said they were unhappy because Mashaba had postponed the state of the city address, which was due to take place on Tuesday. They also complained about the closure of the food bank, sexist comments Mashaba had reportedly made against senior managers of the municipality and Mashaba&rsquo;s claims that title deeds had been withheld by the ANC.The party also accused the mayor of illegally instructing Metro cops not to do their jobs. &ldquo;All this is clear evidence that Mashaba and his DA administration do not understand how local government works. He cancelled the state of the city address because he had no good story to tell about his first 100 days in office,&rdquo; said Makhubo. He said food insecurity was a daily problem many residents of Joburg had to deal with and by closing the food bank, Mashaba was taking food away from poor families. DA Joburg regional chairman Khume Ramulifho said the ANC&rsquo;s claims were just petty opportunism and grandstanding. He added the council meeting scheduled for Tuesday had not been a state of the city address. He said projects like mushroom farms and solar-powered bakeries cost the city R270 million a year and were nothing more than vanity projects.
