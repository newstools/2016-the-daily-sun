THE gay male escort who was a key witness in the Anni Dewani honeymoon murder trial recently committed suicide, apparently because of stress over the case.Leopold Leisser, who went by the name &ldquo;The German Master&rdquo;, testified during the trial of Shrien Dewani. Dewani was accused of masterminding his wife Anni&rsquo;s murder while the UK-based couple were on honeymoon in Cape Town in November 2010.Leisser&rsquo;s sensational testimony about his relationship with Dewani, who later said he was bisexual, made headline news. It was reported yesterday that Leisser was found dead in his Birmingham flat on 13 September. An inquest found that the 2014 trial in Cape Town had stressed Leisser and he had hanged himself.Anni&rsquo;s body was found, with a single gunshot wound, in the back of an abandoned taxi in Khayelitsha on 13 November 2010. Dewani, who has since been acquitted of his role in the murder, had said Anni was killed during a botched hijacking. He was accused of offering three local men &ndash; Zola Tongo, Mziwmadoda Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni &ndash; R15 000 to kill Anni. Tongo entered into a plea and sentencing agreement and was sentenced to an effective 18 years in jail.Qwabe entered into a plea bargain in August 2012 and was sentenced to 25 years in jail while Mngeni died in prison from a brain tumour in October 2014. &ndash; NEWS24/DAILY MAIL
