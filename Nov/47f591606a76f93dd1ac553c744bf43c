THE Sesinyi family hid from the raging storm in their house on Friday night, hoping they&rsquo;d be safe.But when dad Modise Sesinyi (34) heard trees crashing outside at 11pm, he wisely decided to rush his wife and three kids to his mum&rsquo;s place in nearby Kagiso. And his decision saved their lives! The next day he found their house demolished by the wind. The family of five from Mohlakeng, west of Joburg, is now homeless.Heartbroken Modise told Daily Sun: &ldquo;The wind destroyed everything my wife and I have worked hard for. &ldquo;But at the same time, we are grateful we&rsquo;re all alive and no one was hurt. &ldquo;The weather on Friday was fine at first but in the evening it changed and it began to rain.&ldquo;The rain continued and became stronger. At about 11pm the wind got worse. &ldquo;We could hear trees crashing outside. That&rsquo;s when we realised that it was no ordinary wind. I evacuated my family to my mum&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;His wife Tshepiso said: &ldquo;The storm ruined most of our belongings, including our fridge, TV, furniture and appliances.&ldquo;The roof has been ripped apart. We have found shelter at my mother-in-law&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re going to do. &ldquo;We will have to start from scratch and I&rsquo;m asking for any form of help. Any donation would be kindly appreciated.&rdquo;
