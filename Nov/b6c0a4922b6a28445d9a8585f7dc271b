ACHIEVING an A or a B in a test is generally very highly valued. Yet an A or B breast cup size is often under-valued and under-appreciated. We say, screw that!Recently, Vogue boldly declared cleavage is old news. Ridiculous as this statement was, cleavage tends to attract more attention, even when it&rsquo;s deemed &ldquo;over&rdquo;.But we&rsquo;re not in the business of telling women what their bodies should look like.You don&rsquo;t need to dress to up your cleavage level. No. Unless you have a burning desire to strap yourself into a corset, rather dress in a way that sees you embracing your small boobs &ndash; and, in many cases, sees you wearing things big-breasted women find hard to wear.-&nbsp;You can wear plunging, cutout tops without it looking overly sexy. Yup! You can wear blazers without a top (or bra even) underneath and it will still look chic.-&nbsp;No bra needed with halter necklines. Big-boobed girls know the struggle of having to wear a bra, always. So embrace your bumps and bask in the glory of freeing the boob, the underboob and maybe even the nipple!-&nbsp;Hello, bralettes! Let your undies peek out of an open-backed top or dress, a half unbuttoned button-up shirt or wear it solo with a high-waisted pair of jeans to embrace a festival vibe.-&nbsp;Layers. Wearing lots of layers won&rsquo;t make you look frumpy. So play around with cropped tanks and overshirts and slip dresses and tees.-&nbsp;Lace-ups. Small-breasted women give pretty lace-up dresses and tops the credibility they really deserve.
