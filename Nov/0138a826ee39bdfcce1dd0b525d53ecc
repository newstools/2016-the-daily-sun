VAT Alles workers in Nellmapius, Tshwane are furious.They are accusing Councillor Thabo Ntlatleng of nepotism. They allege that Ntlatleng has hired his girlfriend and her friend as his personal secretaries. They claim that the two secretaries &ndash; who used to work with them as street and municipal office cleaners &ndash; are now earning double salaries. The one salary is for being Vat Alles workers and the other one for being secretaries. A Vat Alles worker who did not want to be named with fear of being victimised said the councillor appointed the two without consulting them or following proper procedure. &ldquo;There are people who are volunteering but he chose to hire people who already have jobs, and when the coordinator of the vat alles asked him about the appointments he said the two would be working for him finish and klaar,&rdquo; she said. She said last week Friday members of the community came to protest about the appointment of the two but the councillor send bouncers. &ldquo;Some of the residents who are jobless came to demand the secretaries&rsquo; jobs with their CVs but instead of taking their CVs he sent bouncers who threatened them with fists,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He even threatened the coordinator with bouncers who would beat him to silence&rdquo; she said. According to the angry workers, the two friends are no longer doing their duties as cleaners but they are still on the payroll. &ldquo;They no longer come to work in overalls. They come dressed in fancy clothes and go straight to his office,&rdquo; one of the workers claimed. Daily Sun called Ntlatleng but he declined to comment saying: &ldquo;I cannot discuss the matter over the phone with Daily Sun because you are not a mediator.&rdquo;The councillor&rsquo;s chief whip, Christo van den Heever, has promised to investigate the allegations.
