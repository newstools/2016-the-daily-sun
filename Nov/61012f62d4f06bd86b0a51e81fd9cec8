STEPHEN Lehloenya went to the tavern to enjoy himself.But soon his joy turned to sorrow.He stepped on another patron&rsquo;s Devil&rsquo;s Fork shoes.And Stephen (28), from Wattville in Ekurhuleni, was stabbed. &ldquo;The shoes are expensive but he didn&rsquo;t have to die for such a frivolous thing,&rdquo; said one of the patrons who was at the tavern at the time.After stabbing Stephen the other drinker fled. Cops are looking for him.&ldquo;Taverns are not a safe place. When you are there you have to be very careful who you touch. Some patrons get upset if even a fly lands on their nose,&rdquo; said another man. Sibongile Lehloenya, Stephen&rsquo;s devastated sister, said they were asleep on Saturday night when they heard a knock on the door. &ldquo;We opened the door and a man told us to come and see our brother. When we got there he was still breathing. We called an ambulance but it took too long to arrive. We then got a car to rush him to hospital. &ldquo;But sadly, he died on the way there.&rdquo; A murder case has been opened at &shy;Actonville Police Station.
