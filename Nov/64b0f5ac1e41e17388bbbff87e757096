THE season to divide stokvel money has arrived and many stokvels get robbed of their year-long savings by syndicates who target them.The Durban Regional Court sent a strong warning to would-be stokvel robbers on Tuesday when it sentenced Sakhumuzi Mbokazi (30) and Mthandeni Mkhize (33).The two were sentenced to 10 years imprisonment each for the armed robbery of stokvel members. Following their sentencing, Major-General Bheki Langa who is KZN&rsquo;s acting provincial commissioner, warned residents to rather transfer the stokvel money into their members&rsquo; bank accounts instead of withdrawing large amounts of cash. &ldquo;Those members who don&rsquo;t have bank accounts should open them. We hope that this conviction will serve as a strong warning to the perpetrators.&rdquo;Mbokazi and Mkhize robbed two stokvel members in December last year. The members had just collected a large sum of money from a bank.Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: &ldquo;The victim and her brother were on their way to a supermarket in Overport in Durban to divide money with other stokvel members. While they were walking along Jadhu Place, they were approached by the two accused. They held them at gunpoint and took the money and fled the scene.&rdquo; He said a case of armed robbery was opened by Mayville police. &ldquo;An intensive investigation was then conducted by the investigating officer assigned to the docket and the accused were apprehended. Mbokazi and Mkhize made several court appearances until their sentence.&rdquo;
