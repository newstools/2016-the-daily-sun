Hello MizzbI am 32 years old and I am experiencing a lot of discomfort and sometimes pain in my manhood. This has affected my urine and it has become difficult to get a proper flow when I relieve myself. When in the bedroom, it is hard for the little man to stand . Sometimes he does not stand at all. What could cause this? I admit I drink a lot and I have been doing so for years but it has not been a problem until now. AnonymousHello AnonymousThe symptoms that you are describing could be the result of a number of things. Our bodies are very intelligent and have a way of letting us know when something is not right.It is important for you not to ignore these symptoms and just hope they will go away. Please go to your nearest clinic, men&rsquo;s clinic or doctor for treatment. The sooner you attend to this, the better for your health.
