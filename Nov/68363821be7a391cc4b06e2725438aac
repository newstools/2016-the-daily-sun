WHEN Ernest Masedi went to visit his uncle on Sunday, little did he know that all hell was about to break loose. The 34-year-old was passing through Desmond squatter camp on his way to his uncle&rsquo;s house in Clayville, Ekurhuleni when he ran into a crowd of people fleeing the Red Ants. His family claim he was caught up in the crowd and was nearly beaten to death by the men in red! Speaking from the family house in Tswelopele, his sister Rebecca (38) said: &ldquo;He was with me before he went to visit our uncle. &ldquo;A little while after he had left, a boy passed our house and told me my brother was being beaten by the Red Ants, who were doing an eviction.&rdquo;Rebecca rushed to the scene at about 6pm. &ldquo;I saw a crowd standing around a man lying on the ground. It was my brother and he was covered in blood. He couldn&rsquo;t walk or talk.&rdquo; Ernest was rushed by ambulance to Tembisa Hospital with a woman who had also been injured. Rebecca said: &ldquo;We moved Ernest to a private hospital so that he could get better care. He was released the same day after receiving treatment.&rdquo; Selby Dunn of the Red Ants denied that his workers had been fighting with residents they were evicting from a squatter camp. He said they only used shields to protect themselves. A case of assault was opened at Ivory Park Police Station and the cops are investigating. Lieutenant-Colonel Alstair Subramanian of the Ivory Park police said: &ldquo;No arrests have been made yet.&rdquo;
