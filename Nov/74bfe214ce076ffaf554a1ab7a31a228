GOGO Lesego Dujwa lives in fear of her son&rsquo;s ex-girlfriend. The 56-year-old from Kagiso, in Mogale City, told Daily Sun her son, Mongezi (34), started seeing the woman in 2014 &ndash; and she knew she was trouble from the beginning. &ldquo;After she was kicked out of her parents&rsquo; house, she moved to a squatter camp which is near our house,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I used to be scared Mongezi would get attacked when he visited her, so I suggested they move in with me.&rdquo; Lesego claimed it proved to be a huge mistake as the girlfriend, Nthabeleng Morapedi, soon started bringing men to her house, throwing big parties and insulting her and her son when she was drunk. &ldquo;I got fed up because she would even wash her other boyfriends&rsquo; clothes at my house. She always fought with us and she once even stabbed my son and me.&ldquo;She said she would kill us,&rdquo; claimed Lesego. Mongezi told the SunTeam he regretted the day he met his ex-girlfriend. &ldquo;She stabbed my mum when I told her I wanted to break up and she should move out. &ldquo;Making matters worse, the police laughed at me when I tried to open a case.&rdquo; Daily Sun contacted Nthabeleng, who claimed Lesego was making up stories. &ldquo;That woman is poison.&ldquo;She never liked me. She always wanted to break us up.&ldquo;She made up the stories about me bringing men to the house. &ldquo;As to the stabbing incident, she attacked me first and I was defending myself,&rdquo; she claimed.Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant Kay Makhubela advised Mongezi to report the matter to his police station&rsquo;s commander, who would help him.
