RAPE survivor Cindy Mzobe believes the only cure for abuse is love. She was gang raped by six men and left for dead in 2010. She got up and dusted herself off and now offers counselling and support to victims.The 30-year-old from Tongaat, north of Durban advises victims of abuse not to be bitter after their ordeal but to love themselves. The campaign of 16 days of activism for no violence against women and children began on Friday and will last until 16 December. Cindy told Daily Sun that after she was raped she became bitter and felt a lot of anger and pain. &ldquo;Three years after the rape I decided that it was time to turn my anger into something positive,&rdquo; said Cindy. She registered her non-profit organisation Natakhon South Africa Youth Organisation in 2014. She works with youths from the community and at the Tongaat Trauma Centre. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an amazing team. We visit schools in the area to talk to pupils about abuse and what to do if it happens to you. Most people are afraid to talk about abuse but it is better to speak out than to keep quiet about it.&rdquo; She said she had cases where children came to her and told her that people didn&rsquo;t believe them when they reported being abused or raped.&ldquo;It is sad when people don&rsquo;t believe you. I always tell the young people they should find someone they trust, and I also refer them to the trauma centre,&rdquo; said Cindy. The mother of one who is currently pregnant said she was raped twice &ndash; and she survived. &ldquo;Talking about abuse heals you and prevents further damage in your life. Most victims who keep quiet end up depressed or using drugs. &ldquo;That is not the solution. Speak up and learn to love yourself,&rdquo; said Cindy. She thanks God and the love and support of her husband, Nkosingiphile Mzobe. He is her mentor and a pastor at Marashanta International Ministries.
