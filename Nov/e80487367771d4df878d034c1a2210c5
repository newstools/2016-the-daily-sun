THE Nelson Mandela Foundation has taken a swipe at President Jacob Zuma.In a statement released yesterday, the foundation said it was painful to bear witness to the wheels coming off the vehicle of the state barely three years after the death of Madiba.&ldquo;We call on the governing party to take the steps necessary to ensure that the vehicle of state is protected and placed in safe and capable hands. &ldquo;We support the demand to hold to account those responsible for compromising our democratic state, as well as those looting resources,&rdquo; read the statement.The foundation said it has seen a weakening of critical institutions such as Sars and the national prosecuting authority due to political interference for private interests.&ldquo;We are reaping the results of a political trend of personalising matters of state around a single individual leader. In a constitutional democracy this is to be deplored.&ldquo;The judgment of the Constitutional Court in the matter of Zuma and the use of state resources on a private residence was a test of the ability and commitment of the head of state to be a constitutional being.&ldquo;It is increasingly a national consensus that he has failed the test.&rdquo;The foundation went on to say that the legislative, business and public service sectors are severely affected, compromising the ability of the state to serve the people. &ldquo;A battle now rages to keep Sars attached to the vehicle of state. What public discourse has described as state capture by private and political interests is, we believe, a real threat to the republic.&rdquo;
