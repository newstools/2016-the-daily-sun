A FAKE inyanga&rsquo;s luck ran out when he conned the wrong man. Now the crook is behind bars while his victim, Silver Gumbi, is coming to terms with his loss. Silver (41), a mechanic from Soweto, was scammed out of R138 000 in September. He went to the inyanga for help after he was given a pamphlet at robots in Protea Glen. Silver told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Things were not going well with my business and I thought he could help me. When I got there he told me I had money and my ancestors wanted to double it. He gave me muthi to burn and bath with, and it made me fall for his tricks. I went and withdrew all my money.&ldquo;After the inyanga took my cash he disappeared and no longer took my calls.&rdquo; Silver was helped by an old friend, Pamela Williams. &ldquo;I explained to her what had happened and we set a trap for the inyanga. Pamela met him at his new place and SMSed me the address. I called the cops and they arrested him immediately,&rdquo; he said.On searching the place the police discovered a box with fake R100 notes, muthi and people&rsquo;s photos, some with needles stuck in their faces. &ldquo;The inyanga was shocked when he saw me,&rdquo; added Silver. Constable Vincent Mashiteng said the suspect was arrested on Tuesday and will appear in court on charges of theft under false pretences and possession of fake notes.
