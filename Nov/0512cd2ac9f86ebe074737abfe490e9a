Former ANC Member of Parliament, Vytjie Mentor, has blasted new Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, over claims that she lodged a complaint over the release of an audiotape in the state of capture investigations. &ldquo;I never complained to Mkhwebane about Thuli leaking any tapes,&rdquo; wrote Mentor in capital letters on her Facebook page.The former MP accused the public protector of being a liar.According to a Sunday Times report, Mkhwebane opened a case against her predecessor Thuli Madonsela at the Brooklyn Police station in Pretoria on November 11.This was after Madonsela leaked an audio tape of an interview she had with President Jacob Zuma to news television channel eNCA.Madonsela was quizzing Zuma over several allegations made against him in connection with his relationship with the Gutpa family.The basis of Mkhwebane going after Madonsela is in line with the office&rsquo;s act which states that no one shall disclose the contents of any document in the possession of a member of the Office of the Public Protector or the record of any evidence given before the public protector.Mentor was one of the people who gave evidence to the former public protector and claimed that the Gupta family, with the knowledge of the president offered her the position of minister of public enterprises in favour of her cancelling SAA&rsquo;s route to India.&ldquo;How can an advocate lie like this,&rdquo; asked Mentor in the post.Mkhwebane said Mentor was the third complainant in the matter, following one from the president and the national assembly.The former ANC MP said she would approach the bar-council over the matter, stating that Mkhwebane will have to pay her hugely, indicating that she would be laying charges against the public protector. http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/breaking-vytjie-mentor-accuses-mkhwebane-of-lying-lays-charges-20161127
