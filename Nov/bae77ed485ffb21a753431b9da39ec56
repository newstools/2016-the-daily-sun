SANGOMA Bessy claimed she was evicted from her own indumba by a gang of three tokoloshes. According to Bessy Mafuna (50) from Kagiso extension 11, Mogale City, the tokoloshes, two short women and a short man, are making her life a living hell and wrecking her practice.&ldquo;At first there was a naked ghost that would pass through my house, even during the day. Everyone in the house was complaining,&rdquo; she claimed.&ldquo;In February I went into my indumba to throw bones to find out who the ghost was but then the three short people attacked me.&ldquo;They beat me up and gave me a warning not to come back to my indumba.&rdquo;Bessy said when she told her husband, he told her that he had also seen strange people walking and making a noise in the yard.&ldquo;I went with my husband to the indumba but we both ran out.&ldquo;Since the tokoloshe problem started I have lost my clients.&rdquo;She said her male clients don&rsquo;t like her consulting in her bedroom.&ldquo;They tell me I&rsquo;m not serious. I can&rsquo;t explain to them why I can&rsquo;t take them to the indumba. For the past six months, I have not had a client seeking help.&rdquo;Bessy said when she consults other sangomas, they tell her the tokoloshes in her yard are bringing bad luck and it would be difficult for her to work as a sangoma until the tokoloshes are removed.&ldquo;I have left everything there except the bones that I carried with me to my bedroom.&rdquo; Bessy&rsquo;s husband, Eliot Mafuna (50), confirmed they were chased away by the tokoloshes. &ldquo;I sometimes hear noises in the yard at night like horses stampeding, but when I check there is nothing there.&rdquo;
