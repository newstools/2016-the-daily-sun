The SABC3 has allegedly decided to can local weekday telenovela, High Rollers, within 30 days.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s said the producers are fighting back, determined the show will remain on air. The SABC launched High Rollers in April 2013 in the 8.30pm time slot, with hour-long episodes.&nbsp; The channel then revamped the drama for a second season last year, moving it to 7.30pm as a half-hour programme.&nbsp; In May the show was renewed for a third season, comprising 156 episodes, and extended from three to five days per week. No longer a telenovela, it was described as a prime time weekday soapie. Production company, Rous House Production, said it was told the SABC was taking the decision to can High Rollers "based on programming strategy changes to SABC3."But Rous House said it was working with the public broadcaster to "resolve this matter."The SABC had not responded to our enquiries about the decision to end the run of High Rollers by the time the People&rsquo;s Paper went to print.
