BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic will be firing on all cylinders as they gun for their first home victory when they play Baroka FC in an Absa Premiership match at Dr Molemela Stadium tonight (7.30pm), says midfielder Musa Nyatama.Phunya Sele Sele have been struggling in front of goal which has seen them make a poor start to the season, leading to the resignation of coach Serame Letsoaka. Joint caretaker coaches, John Maduka and Lehlohonolo Seema, have yet to register victory after two games at the helm, notching up a 1-0 loss to Cape Town City and goalless draw with Polokwane City. Celtic are 13th with six points.Nyatama said they would take advantage of the PSL rookies&rsquo; leaky defence, which has conceded 13 league goals so far. Baroka have the second worst defensive record in the league after third from bottom Highlands Park and basement side Ajax Cape Town. He said: &ldquo;We want maximum points and will go on an all out attack. Baroka are vulnerable in defence and we will exploit their weaknesses. We need to score two or three goals. &ldquo;We always discuss our games and the fact that our defence is solid has increased our confidence. Spirits have been high since the start of season, but unfortunately we are not winning. It has been frustrating, we thank our fans for being patient.&rdquo;Nyatama realises the Limpopo side won&rsquo;t be a walk in the park after holding giants Kaizer Chiefs (0-0) and SuperSport United (1-1) in their league games. Baroka are ninth in the league table with 10 points from nine games.Explained Nyatama: &ldquo;Baroka likes to keep the ball and we know how to close them down.&rdquo;
