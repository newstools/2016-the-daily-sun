FOLLOWING the deaths of two young men, a number of churches, civil society groups and government officials have called for the summer initiation season to be banned.Teboho Molakeng (17) and Mpho Khaole (23) were hacked to death last Sunday in Bophelong, Vaal.It happened during a fight between two gangs known as the Diamonds and Mopheme. At a public meeting and prayer session held at Bophelong Stadium on Sunday, speakers told residents a temporary ban on initiation schools was the only way to end the violence. In June, there were two gang wars in the area and many feared the latest clash could cause another war. Emfuleni mayor Simon Mofokeng agreed that a ban was necessary. &ldquo;During last year&rsquo;s summer initiation season, I was called to the mountains after a man was gruesomely murdered and buried with his hand sticking out of a shallow grave. I condemn this as I came from a genuine initiation school myself,&rdquo; said Mofokeng. The mayor said the rise in fake initiation schools has caused many problems. &ldquo;What is happening in the Vaal is the result of gangsters and that must be stopped. The parents who want their kids initiated should rather take them to Lesotho.&rdquo; Mofokeng said the municipality will work with the community and police to bring an end to gang violence and assaults and kidnapping related to initiation. &ldquo;We have witnessed the killings by the gangsters but this didn&rsquo;t start recently. They started killing each other in the mountains and now they are killing each other in our communities. &ldquo;We are going to stop this,&rdquo; he said.
