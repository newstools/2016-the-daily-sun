EVERY day, these municipal workers are forced to sit at the back of a roaring truck on plastic school chairs!They have to endure the pouring rain, fierce winds and scorching sun on the roofless truck, carrying no fewer than 21 workers from the department of roads and storm water at the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality.Yet, through their constant journey of fixing potholes and blocked drains all over the city, the workers have to be extra careful when gears are changed!The SunTeam caught up with them in front of the Uitenhage Town Hall, sitting in their school chairs. A 52-year-old worker said: &ldquo;We often have to cling to each other&rsquo;s overalls when the driver hits the brakes.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s chaos when the driver overtakes. The chairs bend forward, backwards and sideways, exposing us to danger! &ldquo;We shout to the driver to slow down.&rdquo;Another worker (47) said sometimes schoolchildren mock them.&ldquo;They often see the orange chairs and label us as Abet students! &ldquo;Others accuse us of stealing their school chairs and demand them from us. We picked up these chairs in scrapyards because there are no seats at the back of the truck. We often complain, but management tells us mayor Athol Trollip is focussing on saving millions instead of spending. We remove dead dogs and take out dead babies from drains all over the city. But climbing onto the back of the truck and sitting like school kids is the most humiliating thing about our job,&rdquo; the worker said.Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: &ldquo;We are aware of the shortage of trucks and vehicles in the Despatch depot. The municipality is in the process of getting six 3-ton crew cab trucks, of which the majority will be allocated to Despatch and Uitenhage.&rdquo;
