SASSA card holders should be warned that changes are being made to the system.The South African Social Security Agency is making these changes to address widespread complaints from grant beneficiaries that strange or inflated deductions are made from their social grants.Change 1: The use of green cardsThe green cards that many Sassa card holders have will no longer be accepted at government pay points. Only the official white Sassa cards will be accepted at these pay points. This change comes in with immediate effect.The green cards can, however, still be used at supermarket pay points.Sassa&rsquo;s KZN spokesman Mbizeni Mdlalose said they are taking this step to give the public the strong message that they do not encourage the use of green cards at all.The green cards are given to Sassa card holders by money lending companies because it makes it easier for these lenders to make deductions.However, Mdlalose said: &ldquo;This is not fraud because the grant beneficiary gives them consent. But we advise against doing this.&rdquo;Change 2: Cancellation of direct deductionsFrom 1 December, all direct policy deductions coming off the white Sassa cards will be cancelled by Sassa. This is only for those receiving grants for temporary disability and child support grants.This is because these grants are temporary, and Sassa is concerned that grant recipients will not be able to meet their premiums once the grants are cancelled.Those receiving those grants must make new arrangements with their service providers.Mdalose added that permanent grant beneficiaries who want premiums deducted from their grants must go to Sassa offices in person and give written permission.He also reminded pensioners that no more than 10% of the grant can be deducted for premiums, and this can only be for funeral policies.Sassa can be contacted on 0800 6010 11 or 012 400 2322.
