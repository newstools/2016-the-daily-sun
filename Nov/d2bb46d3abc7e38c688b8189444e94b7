Donald has proven to be a racist abusive thug. &ndash; A Heynes____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________"I will be following from my phone .

I wish the very best to madam Hillary Clinton to win the presidential race." - S. Abdallah____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________"I watched the 2007/08 and 2011/12 US elections but this time around it's ludicrous.
