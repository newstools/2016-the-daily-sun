WHEN Mthandeni Dlamini lost his job, he decided to farm to support his family. However, the 44-year-old from Ixopo, southern KZN, soon saw his dream go up in smoke. Mthandeni told Daily Sun he was scammed by a farmer from Kimberley, Northern Cape, who took R16 500 from him for 20 goats that were never delivered. &ldquo;I saw an advert on the internet in August and ordered 20 goats for R450 each. I deposited a total of R9 000 into his bank account the same day,&rdquo; he said. After a week had gone by and Mthandeni had still not received any goats, he phoned the farmer. &ldquo;He demanded R5 000 more for insurance. I paid it but then he wanted R2 500 for delivery, which at first he&rsquo;d said was free.&ldquo;He started avoiding my calls and when I finally got through to him he demanded another R2 500. &ldquo;That was when I went to the police. However, they said they couldn&rsquo;t help because he was in another province.&rdquo; The farmer, Aarif Muhammed, told the SunTeam over email that Mathandeni never paid the delivery costs. He wouldn&rsquo;t say how much money he had received and later stopped replying to messages. KZN police spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane, advised Mthandeni to report the matter to his local station commander. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say what case should be opened because I don&rsquo;t have all the details.&rdquo;
