MASHABELA Malungane (36) claims that a police officer stole his money. He said the officer robbed him after he was arrested for having dagga on him. The father of two from extension 24 in Nellmapius, Tshwane said he was at his fruit stall when he was arrested on 17 October. &ldquo;Two policemen from Mamelodi East Police Station arrived at my stall. One of them handcuffed me and searched my pockets. He found R1 285 and I asked him to give it to my wife, who had rushed to the scene after hearing that the police were at my stall. &ldquo;But he refused and told me I had the right to remain silent,&rdquo; Mashabela said. He was arrested and spent 11 days in jail. He said after he was released on bail he went to the police station to get his money back. But he was surprised when he was given only R622.&ldquo;The officer who assisted me told me that according to my file I had R622 on me when I was arrested.&rdquo; Mashabela said he left the police station devastated and went home to tell his wife the bad news. &ldquo;My wife was my witness that I had R1 285 on me. &ldquo;She told me to lay a charge, but I&rsquo;m still seeking legal advice.&ldquo;Luckily for me, I know the name of the officer who took the money. &ldquo;I want the R663 back that the cop kept for himself,&rdquo; Mashabela said.He said he needs the money to buy Christmas clothes for his children.Daily Sun spoke to Captain Michael Mbewe of the Mamelodi East police, who advised Mashabela to come to the station to resolve the matter. &ldquo;He should not have left the station without resolving the matter or speaking to the station commander,&rdquo; Mbewe said.
