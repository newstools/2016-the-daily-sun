THE Mlambo family is furious because they literally live in shit. The family from Braamfischerville in Soweto said they are drowning in sewage all over their yard. According to the family, the sewage has also swept through the house and they&rsquo;ve been living like that for three weeks. Brenda Mlambo (29) said: &ldquo;Things have gone from bad to worse and we are now forced to evacuate the house because of the kak. &ldquo;The whole place is covered in it and as you can imagine living in a house covered, knee high, in shit, we are unable to do anything as the whole place stinks. We can&rsquo;t even cook because there are flies everywhere.&rdquo; Brenda said what worries her the most was that their children&rsquo;s health is at risk. &ldquo;My son Lethabo is only 14 and now has a skin infection because of this.&rdquo;The aunt, Margaret Motupa (35) said they have approached Joburg Water several times but all they get are empty promises. David Siya of Joburg Water said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take the reference number and forward the matter to see who should be attending to the Mlambos&rsquo; issue.&rdquo;
