According to Enca Prophet (Detective) Lethebo Rabalago&nbsp;from the Mountzion General Assembly in Limpopo uses Doom insect killer to heal people.The church's Facebook page (MZGA) mentions that prophet Rabalago "begins to speak to demons in order to address problems people face each day.&nbsp;He then drives them out of their bodies to free the people." People toke to social&nbsp;media to voice their opinions on this matter: I find this very disturbing. A pastor from the MZGA congregation is spraying people with Doom insect repelant to heal them. pic.twitter.com/NEgJyE2AMj&mdash; Aki Anastasiou (@AkiAnastasiou) November 21, 2016People out here getting "healed" by Doom...Now I've seen it all..If someone sprayed me with Doom it would "bug" me pic.twitter.com/Rm45KfSUrL&mdash; Ronald Phiri (@RonaldPhiri01) November 20, 2016This is very disturbing! https://t.co/0M8lfHWrhL&mdash; Nontobeko Sibisi (@Nontobek0Sibisi) November 21, 2016
