OPPOSITION parties have called on President Jacob Zuma to resign after his bid to have the release of the State Capture report delayed failed. The North Gauteng High Court yesterday ordered that former public protector Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s final report should be released by 5pm. This came after news broke in the morning that Zuma had decided to withdraw his application. DA leader Mmusi Maimane said it was a historic day for South Africa. He said his party knew Zuma&rsquo;s case was without merit from the beginning. &ldquo;It was a malicious delaying tactic to halt the inevitable release of the report, which no doubt implicates the president.&rdquo; EFF leader Julius Malema said his party made sure the report would be released. &ldquo;We are going to do everything to fight the ANC and Zuma.&rdquo; ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa said the party was looking forward to the release of the report as it viewed allegations of state capture in a serious light. &ldquo;This matter impacts on people&rsquo;s confidence in the democratic state as governed by the ANC.&rdquo; Zuma&rsquo;s lawyer, Anthea Platt, told the North Gauteng High Court that her client had instructed her not to go ahead with the case. The DA&rsquo;s lawyer, Etienne Labuschagne, said the interdict was an abuse of power. He said Zuma had used his office to forward his personal interests. Dali Mpofu, who represented Cope and the UDM, said the court should order the president to pay his costs personally. &ldquo;The law cannot be used to shield corrupt people. In this matter, we are seeing more aggravated abuse of process.&rdquo; Madonsela said the withdrawal of Zuma&rsquo;s application to interdict the report appeared to be the right thing to do. The report was supposed to have been released on 14 October.
