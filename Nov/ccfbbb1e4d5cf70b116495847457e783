ORLANDO Pirates&rsquo; interim coach Augusto &ldquo;Njenje&rdquo; Palacios wants goals!That was the point made to his players by Palacios, who has been working non-stop to improve their finishing ahead of tonight&rsquo;s Absa Premiership clash with Baroka FC at the New Peter Mokaba Stadium (7.30pm).Said Palacios yesterday as he wound up training: &ldquo;The team is improving with every game. But the most important aspect we still need to work on is finishing. We have worked hard all week on shooting practice. I told the players it is not just Tendai Ndoro who can score. We can all score goals. &ldquo;If we can&rsquo;t score we can&rsquo;t win, it&rsquo;s as simple as that.&rdquo;&ldquo;We scored three goals (all 1-0 league wins) and conceded one in the four games I&rsquo;ve been in charge. We need to make sure we put the ball in the back of the net.&rdquo;Zimbabwean star Ndoro has scored nine of Bucs&rsquo; 10 league goals this season, while captain Oupa Manyisa scored the other goal via a penalty. And that is why Palacios is worried his other players are not properly assisting Ndoro.The coach stressed that the players were over their disappointing 1-0 loss to SuperSport United in last weekend&rsquo;s Telkom Knockout semifinal played at Mbombela Stadium.That was the former Peruvian World Cup star&rsquo;s only defeat in four games.He said he was concerned about Baroka but told his players this is a must-win game: &ldquo;Baroka are like Chippa United. They are dangerous and play good football. They will be tough , so we must be ready.&rdquo;Palacios added that with four games remaining in 2016 he wanted maximum points: &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to drop points. We need to beat Baroka. We have to go there in a positive frame of mind, looking for three points.&rdquo;Bucs will be minus key defender Thabo Matlaba, who was sent off against Matsatsantsa for a bad tackle on Jeremy Brockie.But Palacios said he had depth and would look to the likes of Patrick Phungwayo and Ayanda Gcaba to fill in for Matlaba.
