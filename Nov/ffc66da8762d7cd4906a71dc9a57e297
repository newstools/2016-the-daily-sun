Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said on Thursday that the club's 'door is always open' for Steven Gerrard if he wants to return in a coaching capacity.Gerrard, who is widely considered to be Liverpool's greatest ever player, announced his retirement after an 18-year career which started at Anfield in 1998.The former Reds captain has been linked with a coaching role at his former club and Klopp said he will help the 36-year-old if he wants to get his managerial career off the ground.Klopp told reporters: "The door is always open for him. From our side, if he wants to make whichever career change from his former career, then we want to help him. There's nothing else to say."The German mentor also stressed to the media that they should give Gerrard time and space to decide his next move.The former Borussia Dortmund boss added: "Steven Gerrard, 186 goals, the first thing what you should all learn is if somebody wants to help Steven Gerrard then stop being so excited about the next step."In life you need space to jump into the next thing that is new. He was a young player and now he will be a young whatever. I'm the wrong person to talk about it."
