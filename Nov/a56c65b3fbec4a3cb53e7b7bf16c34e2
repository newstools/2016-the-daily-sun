THE tenant staggered into his room with two women on Saturday night, but his stern landlord would have none of it. &ldquo;One woman in, one out,&rdquo; Leonard Nyati (61) told the young man, who after some hard words did as instructed and the women left.But just as everything returned to normal, the women came rushing back and attacked the landlord! Leonard, from KwaNobuhle kasi in Uitenhage, told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I told both women to leave and they eventually did. He went alone to his room.&rdquo;Leonard, a former taxi driver, said within minutes, one of the women came storming back! She charged at him, landing a fierce punch to his chest.&ldquo;Later the woman broke a window and jumped through it. I was shocked &ndash; but then I heard a cracking sound and felt a jolt as the other woman beat me with a broom.&ldquo;I spent hours at a clinic and at the police station. These women should be punished for attacking me and damaging my house. A cop at the police station urged me to rather ask the tenant to replace the broken window but I want to open a case of assault against his girlfriends!&rdquo;Captain Gerda Swart said Leonard can still open a case at the police station.&rdquo;
