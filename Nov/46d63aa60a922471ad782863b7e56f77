THIS mum is furious with her 11-year-old son&rsquo;s teachers. The 37-year-old from Ga-Rankuwa in Tshwane claims her son was beaten by two teachers on a school trip because he was over excited on the bus. The mum &ndash; who cannot be named to protect her child&rsquo;s identity &ndash; said the grade 4 pupil at Lebogang Primary School was very excited about the trip to African Island Beach Resort in Hartbeespoort on Saturday. However, what was supposed to be a day of fun turned into a nightmare when a man and a woman teacher allegedly beat him for hanging his head out of the bus window and singing. The mum said when her child came home, his school uniform was stained with blood and he told her what had happened. She took her son to the doctor and had a meeting with the principal and the teachers the next day. &ldquo;They apologised and asked me not to take the matter forward. They promised to pay the doctor&rsquo;s fees and the costs of transporting him there.&rdquo; However, the next day, the teachers phoned her and said they couldn&rsquo;t afford to pay her. The angry mum said her child was left with a hearing problem and had nightmares. Ga-Rankuwa police spokesman Captain Matthews Nkoadi said a case of common assault was opened but no arrests had been made yet. Gauteng Department of Education acting spokesman Oupa Bodibe said: &ldquo;The matter has been reported to our dispute management unit for appropriate action.&rdquo;
