A GOGO&rsquo;S disability is making life hard for her family. The family of 14 live in an RDP in Mzamomhle township, East London. Blind Nonceba Maki (59) lives with four relatives, Ntsikelelo Ngangile (55), Zukiswa Ngangile (47), Thembinkosi July (46) and Lydia Lindelwa (41). She has three kids, Fundiswa (36), Amanda (28), Honey (26) and six grandkids aged 10 months to 20 years.They survive on five child grants. In 1987, Nonceba was kicked in her right eye and then went blind. Last year, she lost the sight in her other eye. Nonceba said she receives treatment at Frere Hospital. &ldquo;Sometimes I miss dates because I don&rsquo;t have money. I have to pay for a companion and myself. The situation is very bad here. &ldquo;I survive on the five grandchildren&rsquo;s social grants. Sometimes we go to bed on empty stomachs because these grants aren&rsquo;t enough for the whole family. These kids were supposed to go to creche but their money is taking care of the family,&rdquo;Nonceba also has high blood pressure. Sometimes she can&rsquo;t take her medicine as she doesn&rsquo;t have food.Sassa spokesman Thamsanqa Singeni said: &ldquo;For a disability grant, a doctor&rsquo;s certificate confirming the disability is required. The health department must attend to it. A report confirming the patient&rsquo;s status is needed. She must visit our offices nearby for help.&ldquo;I will send you the number of the office manager who she can speak to. If there is no joy there, I must be advised to explore another avenue urgently.&rdquo;
