WHEN she lost her husband late last year, Olycia Ndongeni didn&rsquo;t suspect that more misery lay in store for her. But this year, things got even worse when she lost R1 million to a bogus lawyer!The 64-year-old from Masimini section in KwaThema, Ekurhuleni, said the trouble started when she received a letter from an attorney requesting the title deed to her house. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t understand it and went to the police station for help. But before I could enter the charge office, a woman who said her name was Yandisa &ldquo;Jam Jam&rdquo; Mbeki approached me and said she could help me find good lawyers.&ldquo;She told me someone was trying to sell my house and she would help me fight it. She demanded money for court expenses. In two months, my life savings were wiped out. &ldquo;I went as far as borrowing money from mashonisas, family and friends to pay the lawyer. I even got a R100 000 loan from the bank. Yandisa told me I would eventually get all the money back.&rdquo;Olycia said when she added up all the money she had given Yandisa, she was shocked to discover it was nearly R1 million. That was when she started suspecting she had been scammed. She soon found out her house was not on the market, Yandisa was not a lawyer and the letter she received was part of the scam.Captain Mavela Masondo, Gauteng police spokesman, said cases of fraud and impersonating an attorney were opened. He said anyone with information about Yandisa&rsquo;s whereabouts should call Crime Line on 08 600 10 111 or go to their nearest police station.
