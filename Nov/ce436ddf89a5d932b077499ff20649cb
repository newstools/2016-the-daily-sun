RESIDENTS found themselves stranded on Monday on their way to work following the early morning lock-down of their kasi.Rocks, burning tyres and all sorts of rubbish was spilled at almost all entrances and exits and in the busy streets of Mhluzi, near Middelburg in Mpumalanga. Groups of protesters armed with anything from rocks to knobkerries manned all the intersections.This followed the Steve Tshwete Municipality&rsquo;s interim court interdict preventing residents from occupying land in the extension 6 and Avalon areas of the township earlier this month. Angry residents locked the township down and prevented public transport from entering or leaving.Police spokeswoman Sergeant Nelisiwe Masemola said: &ldquo;So far, no damage or injuries have been reported. &ldquo;We understand the protesters aimed to march to the municipality or the magistrates court, but this would be an illegal march because no formal application had been made. &ldquo;The police are monitoring the situation.&rdquo;Attempts to identify the leaders of the protest drew a blank. Earlier this month, a meeting between the protesters, the police and the municipality was held, where it was agreed that the land grab would not continue. But both the cops and municipality were caught off guard by Monday&rsquo;s protest.The final decision over the court interdict will be known on Tuesday.
