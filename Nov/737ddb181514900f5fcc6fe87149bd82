KAIZER Chiefs head coach Steve Komphela finds himself under increasing pressure as Amakhosi stumble from one disappointing result to the next.And that pressure cooker could explode when Amakhosi host in-form Cape Town City at the FNB Stadium tonight (7.30pm).City, fresh from their 4-1 triumph over Free State Stars in the semifinals of the Telkom Knockout at the weekend, jointly head the Premiership standings with Bidvest Wits on 20 points.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsutU4Oq6h3IF_K8C3LYDRHlCUoBgfiAFQbBdkbJyONQu8IG4gV_8KaY2Z2ym9odiTeMhozau98OTYUBaG5GqidawH__-esgKpy9Ke8VyH8dU5lo4Pu2tr4pvWDFv4vCZZdT1TUqHMjUZhRXPPaPa5djQU9G6pBOkwI3zQHGx_0xeO1Pu65orIUtgEI84nu0B3RV1-xZhUEZSrnrIqzhpYc3XOx2KbofifSa-WyQ3q48jxADrum7KHX-6mN5w39WQGwwQWJzEyEiILKqJT8nG2IFyw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzItMKa2gvbzDEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Komphela admits his charges are short on confidence and badly need a win to boost morale. He also needs to appease club supporters who were baying for his blood at the same venue last Wednesday following their 1-1 draw with SuperSport United.He said: “City are on a high as far as confidence is concerned. We are not at the right level of confidence but that is no excuse.“I expect City to play their usual counter-attacking game. They beat us that way in the MTN8. They are lethal on counter-attacks and good on set-pieces. They have a lot of variation in their play and a number of top players.”The player he fears most is City’s captain and midfield ace, Lebogang Manyama, who scored against Stars.And City head coach Eric Tinkler knows how tough it can be as coach of one of the Soweto giants. He led Orlando Pirates to the 2015 Caf Confederation Cup final but his contract was not renewed at the end of the season. After Chiefs, CT City play Wits in a top-of-the-table scrap at Bidvest Stadium on Friday.Said Tinkler: “So far, so good. But it will be a testing four days. The cup final has been forgotten for now. We need to concentrate on getting more points. I’m wary of Chiefs when they are not at their best.”The coach has a huge headache but one he is not complaining about and that is who to play at the heart of defence.Tinkler was forced to bring back Thato Mokeke and Ghana Under-20 defender Joseph Adjei at centre-back when regulars Robyn Johannes and Tshepo Gumede got suspended.Gumede returns but Tinkler was full of praise for Adjei: “He is a talented youngster. He did extremely well. When he was given the chance he took it and stepped up to the plate. It has given me a selection headache but one I’m happy to have.”
