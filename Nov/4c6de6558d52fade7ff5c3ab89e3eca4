KAIZER Chiefs coach Steve Komphela was booed by the fans following his decision to substitute goal scorer George Lebese in their 1-1 draw against SuperSport United in the PSL match played at FNB Stadium yesterday. Die hard Chiefs&rsquo; supporters were unhappy that Lebese had to come off 20 minutes before stoppage time. Amakhosi have been struggling recently, having collected only three points from a possible 12 points in the league.They played to a goalless draw against Orlando Pirates and Baroka FC before going down to Free State Stars in the quarter-finals of the Telkom Knockout. Lebese has failed to make it to the starting lineup on three occasions. He didn&rsquo;t start in Chiefs&rsquo; game against Baroka, Stars in the TKO and against Mamelodi Sundowns on Saturday, where they lost 2-1.However, Komphela gave his reasons why he opted to replace the left winger and bring in youngster Emmanuel Letlotlo.Komphela said: &ldquo;The midfield was very tired and it was a matter of who wins the second ball. There were stages where the ball went on top and Brockie or Grobler had it, but when it came back the player from the midfield who breaks the line missed the two strikers by inches.&ldquo;There was no much space, especially in the middle, and I thought George (Lebese) did very well. Katsande also played well. I thought of bringing on fresh legs with 20 minutes left and at one point I thought of bringing Letlotlo on with that element of speed.&rdquo;Added Komphela: &ldquo;Rightly so, the fans say no, don't take Lebese out. Fans are always right, they can never be wrong. But one thing that you need to do as a coach is to take decisions and you live by your decisions. If I knew what I know now then obviously the decisions that I took through the entire game would have been different.&rdquo;&nbsp;
