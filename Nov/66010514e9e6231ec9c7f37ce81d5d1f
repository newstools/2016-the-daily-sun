CHURCH members were worshipping God when a storm suddenly hit them.Church members at Thombho a Vhuchilo Apostolic Church in Tshivhulani Village, in the Vuwani area of Limpopo were lucky to escape death as the storm was so strong it blew the roof of the church off. The storm, which lasted almost 30 minutes, also left many community members with damaged houses. Bishop Elijah Malatjie said God saved them as the rain started just as the service had begun and many people had not arrived yet. &ldquo;At least no one got injured as people managed to run out of the church building. However, we lost everything in the storm.&rdquo;The bishop said they were desperate to rebuild the church but they didn&rsquo;t have the money to do so. He appealed to Good Samaritans to help them repair the roof.Joyce Mulaundzi, a church member, said the congregation had to worship under a tree. She added that all the furniture in the church had been destroyed. However, she said the rain was needed as the area was still struggling because of the severe drought. Resident Nkhesani Tshishonga said many people had been left homeless, but she was happy no one was injured.She appealed to the government to assist those who&rsquo;ve lost their homes.
