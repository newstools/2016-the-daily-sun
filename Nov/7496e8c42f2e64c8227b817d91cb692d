Yesterday DA Leader Mmusi Maimane took to twitter to address the #CoffinAssault case of &nbsp;Theo Jackson and Willem Oosthuizen, the two men who allegedly forced a black man into a coffin.&nbsp;The alleged assault of Victor Mlotshwa took place at the JM de Beer Boerdery, next to the Komati power station in Mpumalanga.&nbsp; This is what Maimane tweeted and&nbsp;after that... he was slammed for promoting black&nbsp;on white violence.Waiting for the two #coffincase people who act in despicable manner against the South Africa we ought to build. Racism must be destroyed. pic.twitter.com/CfIc23ElDT&mdash; Mmusi Maimane (@MmusiMaimane) November 16, 2016@chuene6 @moloisrj @VuyoNgumbela @MmusiMaimane @Our_DA When #Malema says: slaughter whites, not yet, #FarmMurders all racial! #Mmusi #OneWay&mdash; werner (@wernersmit2010) November 17, 2016@anton50 @MmusiMaimane Wheres #Mmusi's anger at Malema wanting to slaughter whites maybe later?
