THE past 10 years have been difficult for the Mahlangu family, with members dying one after the other.Madala Johannes Mahlangu (62) from GaMoloi Village outside Jane Furse, Limpopo now fears for his own life.And worse, he fears death will visit his two young nieces.Johannes&rsquo; parents, Jack and Maria died 10 years ago after an illness. Then his brother Barnett (45) died in 2013 from high blood pressure. His brother George (42) was shot and killed in Gauteng in 2015 and Martha (35), his sister who was the breadwinner, died in car crash last year.Johannes told Daily Sun instead of burying their parents with dignity, his siblings fought over R500 from a burial society. And they didn&rsquo;t perform rituals. &ldquo;Death and poverty have stolen my happiness. When my brother Barnett died I had a stroke. A sangoma saved me but after I recovered I started feeling a pain in my leg.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nothing good comes my way. Every time I find a woman she leaves me when she see where I live. I applied for an RDP house but it was left unfinished.&rdquo;Lemson Moropjane, Makhuduthamanga Municipality spokesman, said they were not aware of the matter and would investigate. Dr Kon&rsquo;asi Makhubele, a Thulamela traditional leader, said: &ldquo;He must get help from a sangoma to cleanse his home and perform rituals.&rdquo;
