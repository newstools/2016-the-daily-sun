ALCOHOL and swimming don&rsquo;t mix.The police have warned people to be careful after a number of people recently drowned at Durban beaches and other areas on the KZN South Coast.KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: &ldquo;As we approach the festive season, drowning is a risk for people who go on outings to rivers, beaches, dams and swimming-pools. &ldquo;Many drowning incidents are linked to the misuse of alcohol and recklessness.&rdquo; Last Saturday evening, a 16-year-old girl drowned while allegedly drunk at Laguna Beach in Durbant.&ldquo;Alcohol weakens people&rsquo;s judgement and they take unnecessary risks. &ldquo;A drunk swimmer will get tired more easily, increasing the chance of an accident or drowning,&rdquo; said Zwane.He said before entering the sea, swimmers must take time to watch the waves. They must avoid places where there is a strong backwash, a rip current or the danger of being washed onto the rocks. &ldquo;Check the weather and the tides before you leave home. If the sea is too rough, you could be swept away. &ldquo;Only enter where the waves are straight and gentle,&rdquo; he warned.He said swimmers must also check with the lifeguards on duty what the surf conditions were before swimming. &ldquo;Avoid swimming immediately after a big meal, as there is the danger of cramp,&rdquo; Zwane said.&ldquo;Do not swim in river mouths, in dirty water, early in the morning, early in the evening or after it has rained as shark activity increases in these conditions.&rdquo;Zwane also warned parents never to leave young children unattended near water.
