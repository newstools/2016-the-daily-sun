AN ANGRY crowd got back the pair of takkies from the alleged suspect but that didn&rsquo;t stop them from beating him to death. Sanele Makhanya, from J section, KwaMashu, north of Durban allegedly confessed to stealing a pair of All Star takkies. He even went to show the angry residents where he had sold them. But they beat him until he took his last breath.The 27-year-old allegedly stole the shoes from a woman near his home on Monday. Residents claim he disappeared from the area after the incident.According to his aunt, Nokuthula Ngcobo (43), the woman came looking for him on Tuesday.&ldquo;The woman and her boyfriend were asking for Sanele. We didn&rsquo;t know where he was. We told the woman to report him to the police.&rdquo; Nokuthula said they thought the woman had reported Sanele to the cops.&ldquo;But on Thursday we heard from a neighbour that they had found him. The neighbour told us that Sanele was going to show them who he had sold the takkies to. We didn&rsquo;t think anything would happen to him.&rdquo; She said on Friday morning they got a phone call informing them that he had been beaten and dumped in a passage.&ldquo;Other neighbours told us that after residents got the takkies, they took him to some nearby open ground where they beat him with dangerous weapons.&rdquo; Nokuthula said they rushed him to a clinic but he died on arrival. &ldquo;This shocked us because Sanele was killed by our neighbours.&rdquo;The sad aunt said the family still hoped that one day he would change.&ldquo;He was a whoonga addict but he didn&rsquo;t deserve to be killed in that manner. I want them to be arrested and given tough sentences.&rdquo; Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, KZN cops spokeswoman, confirmed that KwaMashu police had received a report of murder.&ldquo;Cops found Sanele with multiple wounds. He was allegedly assaulted by residents. A case of murder was opened and is under investigation. &ldquo;No arrests have been made.&rdquo;
