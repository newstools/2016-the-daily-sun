MCEBO Dlamini claims he was arrested yesterday for supporting EFF leader Julius Malema during his court appearance in Bloemfontein on Monday. Thabo Kwinana, the lawyer representing the student leader from Wits University in Joburg, told Daily Sun four cops grabbed Dlamini at his residence and forced him into an unmarked police car. &ldquo;They came at about 5am. They took him to Alexandra Police Station and asked him about a speech he made at Malema&rsquo;s court appearance,&rdquo; said the lawyer. He claimed Dlamini was later told he would be taken to Hillbrow Police Station but he was dropped off in front of the fire station and was forced to walk back home. Kwinana said there was no record of Dlamini at the police station. &ldquo;That is worrying,&rdquo; added Kwinana. Acting national police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane, said several rumours had spread on social media about Dlamini&rsquo;s alleged arrest and all of them turned out to be false. He said police time had been wasted investigating Dlamini&rsquo;s claims.&ldquo;It would seem there has been a deliberate attempt to cast the police in a negative light by an individual or individuals who clearly have an agenda.&rdquo;
