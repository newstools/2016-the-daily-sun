MOST people&rsquo;s lives are only celebrated at their funerals but this wasn&rsquo;t the case for gogo Florina Mofokeng.The gogo was dressed beautifully as friends and family celebrated her 106th birthday in Malatjie squatter camp, Joburg, on Friday. The gogo was born in Lesotho in 1910 and was blessed with eight children and 32 grandchildren.The celebration was organised by Pastor Moalusi Mojapelo (74) and his wife Didi. The two run Refilwe Community Projects, an organisation that provides care to elderly people. The pastor told the SunTeam he met gogo Florina two months ago after sending caregivers to look for elderly people who needed help.&ldquo;One of the caregivers took us to the gogo&rsquo;s house and we were surprised to hear although she was born in 1910, she could still do most things for herself.&rdquo; Pastor Mojapelo said the gogo loved to exercise and do ironing and she didn&rsquo;t suffer from any chronic illnesses like high blood pressure or diabetes.&ldquo;We have been going to visit her twice a week and providing her with groceries. Although her birthday was in September, we thought we couldn&rsquo;t wait until next year to organise a party for her.&rdquo;Gogo Florina said prayer has kept her alive this long. &ldquo;Young people need to love God. We need to teach children to pray and have mercy on others because that is what God wants.&ldquo;I have faith I will live even longer than my elder sister, who is now 108 years old.&rdquo;&nbsp;
