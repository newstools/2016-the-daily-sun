ZIMBABWE is entering a period of acute risk for mass outrage. And things could get worse if President Robert Mugabe dies, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has warned.Aged 92 and increasingly frail, the long-time Zimbabwe president&rsquo;s days are clearly numbered but he still has not named a successor and wants to stand in the 2018 election. Fighting between the G40 faction of Zanu-PF, which has the support of Mugabe&rsquo;s wife and the Lacoste faction aligned to Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa is getting increasingly bitter. This as rival officials try to position themselves to take over in the event of Mugabe&rsquo;s death or incapacitation. This factional fighting could erupt into open violence, warns the Holocaust Memorial Museum&rsquo;s Simon-Skjodt Centre for the Prevention of Genocide in an early warning report released this month. A second plausible scenario of mass outrage in Zimbabwe is a sharp hike in state repression against anti-government protesters. Zimbabwe has since April seen unprecedented public protest in the shape of the #ThisFlag movement, started by Harare pastor Evan Mawarire, who has now had to flee the country. &ldquo;Today there is a potential risk of new mass atrocities in Zimbabwe as Mugabe nears death and planned elections in 2018 approach,&rdquo; the Early Warning Country Report said. It added: &ldquo;We recommend diplomatic engagement with and by regional leaders to communicate that the use of atrocities will not be accepted as a path to power.&rdquo; &ndash; NEWS24
