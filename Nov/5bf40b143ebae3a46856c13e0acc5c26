POVERTY stricken families in the tiny farming town of Rhodes, near Barkley East, are doing what they can to put food in their tummies. When the SunTeam drove past Carlisle Hoek farm, it found a group of women carrying knives.But they were not planning to hurt anyone &ndash; instead were searching for food.They gather and look for green leaves to take home and cook isigwampa, a porridge of the chopped leaves mixed with mealie-meal.Nodathini Mange (24), who is originally from Matatiele, is jobless with two kids.She is married but her husband is a livestock herder at the farm and earns only R1 000 a month.Nodathinidropped out of school while in grade 7 because of financial difficulties at home and got married when she was 18.She lives in a small shack on the farm with her two kids and her husband. During the day Nodathini and other women go out to look for food. She said the number of rape cases was also high so their knives double as protection as they walk in dangerous areas. They can walk for up to 47km. But finding food makes their aching feet worth it when they&rsquo;re able to feed their families.The women said that sometimes tourists and passersby would see them on the side of the road and give them groceries.They receive cooking oil, mealie-meal and sweets for their kids. One particular tourist made one of the women, Nosiphelo Maqaqa, cry because of his kindness. Eric Meier from Switzerland said he visited Rhodes every year and always made sure to bring food so that people could at least have one good meal for the day.
