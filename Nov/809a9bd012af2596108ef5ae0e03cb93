IT WAS was a case of pens down, face down!Security guards found a matric girl who was so drunk she couldn&rsquo;t even tell them her name or where her house was.Guards from Reaction Unit South Africa found her face down in long grass near Wick Street, Verulam, north of Durban on Friday afternoon.A group of pupils were earlier seen boozing at the spot.KZN Education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana had warned parents and pupils of the dangers of pens down parties, but in many cases it appears to have fallen on deaf ears.The girl, who is believed to be about 17, was in her school uniform when the guards found her.The reaction unit&rsquo;s Facebook page requested public assistance to find the family of the girl.&ldquo;Her friends abandoned her after she had passed out,&rdquo; the post read. The guards couldn&rsquo;t trace her identity as she didn&rsquo;t have a schoolbag with her. She was dressed in a green skirt, a blue top and stockings. Meanwhile, at KwaMashu&rsquo;s Fan Park in P section, many pupils from different areas gathered for a massive pens down event where DJ Cndo played.Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t received any information of bad incidents caused by pens down parties.&rdquo;Education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re disappointed that after the MEC&rsquo;s call that pupils should stay away from pens down parties, they still went all out to participate in them. They should realise it&rsquo;s no use celebrating when they haven&rsquo;t got their results yet.&rdquo;
