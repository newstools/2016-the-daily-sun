IN-FIGHTING and squabbles in Safpu have turned out for the worst.And the organisation now faces a bleak future.Dismissed Safpu member, Lovers Mohlala, has opened a criminal case against Safpu&rsquo;s Acting President Tebogo Monyai and General Secretary Thulaganyo Gaushubelwe. He pressed charges for corruption, mismanage of union funds and lack of accountability.Last week Safpu staff were kicked out of their offices at Cosatu House for failing to pay their monthly rental.But Monyai revealed that their offices have been re-opened as there was a minor hiccup.Mohlala has vowed to get Monyai and Gaushubelwe behind bars for corruption.Said Mohlala: &ldquo;I hate people who are corrupt. I won&rsquo;t back down until justice is done and these guys are accountable for the money they spent. &ldquo;They are harvesting what players were supposed harvest. I&rsquo;ve opened a case with the police and they are investigating. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t be exploited by teams and then by the union.&rdquo;Added Mohlala: &ldquo;I want to say to Thulaganyo, Bobo Maseko and Tebogo that I will see you in jail.&rdquo;But Monyai has lashed out at Mohlala and former Safpu president Simba Marumo for dragging his name in the mud.Marumo resigned in June after a motion to pass a vote of no confidence in him, while Mohlala got fired after he pleaded with players to boycott the organisation. Monyai told SunSport: &ldquo;Lovers and Marumo are trying to discredit the union and I won&rsquo;t be shy to correct their bad behaviour.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised that when Cosatu wrote a letter to us they also copied Marumo who is no longer with the union.&ldquo;This means he knows our plans and secrets. We inherited this debt that Marumo didn&rsquo;t pay. But the same people want to expose us, but we&rsquo;re not shy to account to the public.&rdquo;Monyai is accused of spending R236 000 from the union&rsquo;s budget &ndash; an amount he is said to have used to buy Gaushubelwe a new car. But he insisted the move was for benefit the of the union.Explained Monyai: &ldquo;The secretary general is entitled to 75% from the union and he pays 25% from his side.&ldquo;We found this policy there and I don&rsquo;t know who drafted it. Gaushubelwe has worked for three years without getting an allowance. This because the union had financial difficulties.&ldquo;And when funds became available, we saw it fit to buy him a new car.&ldquo;But now it&rsquo;s shocking that Cappy Matotoane (former president) also benefited when they bought him an Astra and these questions were never raised,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware that both Lovers and Marumo are behind this.&rdquo;Marumo was not available for comment.
