ALL Thandanani Nkambule had in mind was to feast on the weekend&rsquo;s leftovers at his neighbour&rsquo;s house. The family had a gathering at the weekend and there still was some traditional beer and meat left over. But the 24-year-old is now lying in hospital without eight front teeth. According to his uncle Domo Mabaso, a squabble ended in Thandanani being severely beaten by the neighbour&rsquo;s two sons. Domo (49), from Vimbukhalo near Jozini, wants his neighbour to pay with a cow for his nephew&rsquo;s injuries and for limiting his chances of getting a wife.&ldquo;My nephew is currently in hospital. If he recovers, he will be looking like a madala because of his missing teeth. No woman will want to be with him. &ldquo;The doctors said he could have brain damage because he suffered serious head injuries. The people responsible for putting him through this should at least pay a cow.&rdquo; The neighbour&rsquo;s uncle, Samson Nhleko (63), said he does not want to talk about the cow. &ldquo;If Mabaso wants to talk he should come to us. His nephew disrespected us and attempted to stab my nephew.&rdquo;KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said Mabaso should &shy;report the matter to the cops.
