Car parts, including the battery, alternator, radiator, wheels and music system had being stripped from the Toyota. The owner of the taxi, Tshepo Tsotetsi, said when he last saw Sipho he was carrying passengers.&ldquo;I was surprised when I received a call from the tracking company at about 11pm informing me the car was moving around and the car battery was disconnected,&rdquo; Tshepo said.He said he immediately knew something was wrong, but he was not prepared for what was to follow. Later the tracking company called to tell Tshepo the car was found burnt and the driver was nowhere to be found. &ldquo;We have searched for Sipho at clinics, police stations, mortuaries and hospitals without success,&rdquo; Tshepo said.
