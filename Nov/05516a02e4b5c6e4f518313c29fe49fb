A MAN of God donated 200 blankets to the oldies in Dipetlelwane Village in the North West on Sunday.Pastor Lebogang Ngobeni of the Ethiopian Catholic Church in Zion in Roodekop, Alberton, said he was prompted to do so after realising that most of the schoolkids he gave guidance talks to were being raised by their grandparents.&ldquo;Together with some members of my church, we visited Morare High School in Pella Village in the North West 10 years ago, and found out that 90% of the pupils were raised by their grandparents.&ldquo;I was touched and decided to donate 86 blankets to the elderly in that area,&rdquo; he said.Ever since then, the pastor has been&nbsp;going from province to province, handing out blankets. He said the elderly, all from different churches, are identified by his church branches. But he doesn&rsquo;t only look after&nbsp;gogos and madalas. While offering pupils career guidance, he counsels them about the dangers of using drugs, teenage pregnancy and the importance of education.&ldquo;Most kids choose easy subjects when they go to tertiary.&ldquo;They ignore the subjects that can benefit them when they are done with their studies. That is where we come in, by guiding them to choose wisely,&rdquo; said the pastor.Since last year, he has donated school shoes and stationery to pupils from needy families. He said the project will also be done annually.&ldquo;All the items I donate are bought with the money we get from raising funds. &ldquo;We also have a good relationship with Aranda Textiles. They give us a discount on our every purchase,&rdquo; he said.
