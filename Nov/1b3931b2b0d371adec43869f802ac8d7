Dear MizzBI met a woman on a dating website. She was nice to me and we started a relationship. She makes me feel like my life is worth living.&nbsp; We then arranged to meet in person. As a gentleman, I sent her money to visit me because she lives in a different province. I have not heard from her since I sent the money.-Stressed Dear Stressed Love is a beautiful thing. However, you need to be cautious whenever you meet someone on a dating website. It is important to carefully examine the other person&rsquo;s intentions. This can only be done by getting to know the person and their expectations of the relationship. Investing money on a person you have never met is not a smart move. It would have been wiser to meet at a place that was convenient for the both of you. Love requires two people to make an effort to be together by investing in each other. Look for someone who will invest in you as much as you are willing to invest in them.
