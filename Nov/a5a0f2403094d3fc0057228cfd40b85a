THE Christian Catholic Church of Zion in KwaNobuhle, Uitenhage has been offering salvation to the community for over 10 years.However, thugs see it an easy target. On Sunday, it was robbed for a third time.And for some strange reason, the thugs stole electric cables and vandalised the holy place but left the collection money lying in plain sight!Reverend Sipho Toise (69) said he went to open the church on Sunday morning.&ldquo;As I walked up to the church at about 10.30, I saw curtains hanging outside a broken window near the front door. I just knew something was wrong.&ldquo;When I saw the front door was open, I immediately went down on my knees and prayed to God to protect his church because we can&rsquo;t afford a caretaker.&rdquo;Church member Nontsikelelo Stuurman (44) said: &ldquo;The thugs left behind three snuff containers. This proves they were smoking drugs while vandalising our church.&ldquo;Strangely, they ignored the money lying on the table and only stole our wall clock and cables.&rdquo; Toise added: &ldquo;We hope cops will arrest the thugs. We will leave everything to God. He will deal with them because they have destroyed his house.&ldquo;A church is a holy place and has to be respected, but today things are different. &ldquo;Thugs no longer fear the power of churches.Church secretary Nonzaliseko Cushe said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m absolutely shocked. We&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have electricity in the church because of these evil tsotsis.&ldquo;God will punish them because they stole holy property that belonged to holy people.&rdquo; Police spokeswoman Lieutenant Gerda Swarts said cops were investigating a case of robbery, but no arrests have been made yet.
