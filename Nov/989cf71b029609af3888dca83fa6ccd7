A 16-YEAR-OLD girl has been released into the custody of her parents after allegedly stealing a six-week-old baby girl in the Ladysmith CBD.The girl was allegedly caught three hours after stealing the baby. She appeared in court on Wednesday last week for child stealing but will only go back to the Ladysmith Magistrates Court when the pending paternity results are available. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, a KZN police spokeswoman, said the girl had befriended a young mother, Lungelo Shezi, at a shopping centre in the Ladysmith CBD last Tuesday. &ldquo;The girl showed a lot of interest in the baby, named Siluleko, and they got into a conversation. The mother allowed her new friend to hold her baby. &ldquo;The girl then convinced the mother to let her play with the baby while she shopped.&rdquo; She said by the time the young mother had finished shopping, the girl and the baby were nowhere to be found.&ldquo;She frantically searched around the centre but to no avail. She quickly made her way to the Ladysmith Police Station and members immediately sprang into action.&rdquo;She said cops viewed video footage at the centre as well as footage from the local public safety camera system. Police then established that she had boarded a taxi to Ezakheni&rsquo;s E section.&ldquo;They went to a house in E section and found the suspect as well as the baby. The baby was unharmed. The mother couldn&rsquo;t hold back tears of joy when her baby was returned to her.&rdquo; Major-General Bheki Langa, the KZN acting provincial commissioner, said: &ldquo;We appeal to mothers not to be convinced by anyone to hand over their baby, no matter how friendly they seem.&rdquo;
