&ldquo;I KNEW that my family was angry when I brought my younger sister to Joburg to get a job. But for them to hold on to so much anger about her death is shocking!&rdquo;These are the words of a troubled Masabata Moshoeshoe (32) from Mohlakeng in Randfontein who is struggling to raise money for her sister&rsquo;s burial.Her sister died three weeks ago and her family in Lesotho is refusing to assist with the burial.Now Masabata is left with the huge responsibility of burying her 25-year-old sister, Belina Moshoeshoe. Belina moved to Joburg three years ago in search of greener pastures at the advice of Masabata. She said: &ldquo;She was home in Lesotho doing nothing constructive with her life after matric. &ldquo;By then I was already living in Joburg and I asked her to join me this side so she could use her hairdressing skills to make some money. &ldquo;My parents and six other siblings were not happy about this and said I was taking my sister to the devil&rsquo;s den,&rdquo; said a heartbroken Masabata.She added Belina had been doing well and had even found her own place to live. &ldquo;She was working hard and sent most of her earnings to the family in Lesotho. She was the major contributor and had big plans for December.&rdquo; Masabata, with some of Belina&rsquo;s close friends, have so far managed to raise R2 600. But the amount is not even close to what the undertaker needs to take the body to Lesotho. &ldquo;A total of R14 000 is needed to bury Belina in Lesotho or R8 000 if buried this side. But my family has told me they won&rsquo;t come to the funeral if it is not in Lesotho,&rdquo; said Masabata.She added she was disappointed at her family&rsquo;s behaviour. &ldquo;I know if they wanted to they would help arrange the funeral. All I wanted was what was best for my sister. She had plans of studying further,&rdquo; she said.Masabata is pleading with SunLanders to help her.
