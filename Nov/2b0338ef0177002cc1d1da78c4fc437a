JUSTICE must be served or we will kill the bastard.That is the stern warning from angry residents of Taliban squatter camp in KwaNobuhle, Uitenhage. They handed a 54-year-old man over to the police for allegedly raping his girlfriend&rsquo;s 14-year-old daughter. Resident Phumza Mxoli (44) said: &ldquo;She told her cousins that her mother&rsquo;s boyfriend had been raping her since June. She was afraid to tell her mother because the man was threatening her.&rdquo;Residents, armed with tyres and knives, said they would teach the man a lesson if he gets bail.&ldquo;We want justice for this girl. If the court fails to punish him, we will tie the bastard to a pole, wrap his 4-5 in a cloth, pour petrol on it and set it alight,&rdquo; a resident said. Captain Gerda Swart said the man will appear in court soon.
