SIPHO Mahlangu (39) of Hammanskraal, in Tshwane loves the People&rsquo;s Paper.He starts his day by getting a copy before going to work.He said that he started reading the paper in 2003 and has never missed a copy.&ldquo;I love the style of Daily Sun stories because they capture the events that take place in the townships, which many papers fail to do. &ldquo;We are able to relate to the stories because we sometimes know the people they write about. And we are motivated by the publicity that they get.&rdquo;He said that his favourite copy was the one with a series of articles covering the funeral of the late first democratically elected president of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.&ldquo;The paper shared an in-depth history about the former president and the life that he led as a leader. It celebrated his life as the legend that he was. &ldquo;Those who didn&rsquo;t know him very well were able to learn more about him. I saved the copies for my children so that when they are older they can read all about him.&rdquo;But some of the copies were burnt when his shack caught fire three years ago.&ldquo;My heart still aches when I think of them but I have started rebuilding my library again.&rdquo; He said that sometimes women who sell chicken feet nearby ask for some copies so that they can use them to wrap up the meat for their customers.&ldquo;They know that I always have a pile of newspapers that I keep. &ldquo;I give them the sports pages and keep the news sections because I don&rsquo;t love sport. &ldquo;I also share with those who stay in informal settlements to use in their pit toilets.&rdquo; He said that he often has to choose between using his last money for a taxi to get to work or to buy the paper.&ldquo;I always choose to buy the paper because I don&rsquo;t want to miss out on anything.&rdquo;
