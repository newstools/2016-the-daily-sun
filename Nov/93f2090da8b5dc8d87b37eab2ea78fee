LET&rsquo;S meet at the Equality Court!This was a joint call made by Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva, chairwoman of the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities together with the Nazareth Baptist Church (Shembe). The call came after the two met on Friday. They have decided to take the department of education in KZN to court for endless cases of discrimination and abuse against children who attend the Shembe Church. Mkhwanazi-Xaluva told Daily Sun that they need affidavits from parents whose children experienced discrimination at various schools in KZN to present their cases to her before Friday.&ldquo;The church leadership will gather the needed information from parents whose children have experienced abuse from teachers with respect to their hair as their church doesn&rsquo;t allow them to cut their hair. I will then start filing papers to approach the court.&rdquo; She said she is hopeful that by the end of next week she will have the exact date when the matter will be tabled before court.&ldquo;We have asked the education department to give a directive to all its schools that teachers should stop physically and verbally abusing schoolgoing Shembe members for keeping their hair uncut. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s their religious belief. &ldquo;But it looks like our efforts were in vain.&rdquo; Mkhwanazi-Xaluva added they&rsquo;ve been flooded with complaints from different schools about teachers who violate pupils&rsquo; rights.Wellington Myeni, a Shembe Church representative has urged all parents who have suffered this fate to come forward.&ldquo;We urge even those whose cases are not yet known to us to come forward.&rdquo; KZN Education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to engage in this matter with them through the media. &ldquo;If they have anything to tell us, they know the right channels they can use to contact us.&rdquo;
