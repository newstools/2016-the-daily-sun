He claimed his problems started in February this year. &ldquo;I used to work as a trolley boy in town. One day after I had just finished eating a banana, I threw the peel in the back of a rubbish truck,&rdquo; he told Daily Sun.&ldquo;Cops saw me and accused me of getting rid of drugs. I told them it was just a banana peel but I lost my job because of them.&rdquo; He thinks his stomach problem started after he was accused of being a drug dealer.&ldquo;My stomach is painful and wind builds up in it. I have to massage it every time I want to fart,&rdquo; he said.Sometimes he spends more than three weeks without relieving himself. Msimange lives with his mum. &ldquo;I was told to go to East London to open a case against the cops who accuse me of being a drug dealer. But I don&rsquo;t have money to go to East London,&rdquo; he said.Captain Jackson Manatha told Daily Sun that Masimange should report the matter to Colonel Sandile Biyana at Butterworth Police Station.
