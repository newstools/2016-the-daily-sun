THE basic education department worked hard to make sure the matric exam papers were kept under lock and key.&nbsp; However, their security wasn&rsquo;t strong enough.&nbsp; YESTERDAY, IT EMERGED THAT MATHEMATICS EXAM PAPER TWO HAD BEEN LEAKED TO PUPILS IN&nbsp; GIYANI, LIMPOPO!&nbsp;The department said it was viewing the leak in the Mopani district in a very serious light and had involved law enforcement agencies, including the Hawks and the SAPS.&nbsp;The department has apparently established that pupils at a number of schools in Giyani had access to the paper before the exam was written.&nbsp; Education department spokesman Elijah Mhlanga said: &ldquo;We are shocked and disappointed by the leak of this exam paper. We are going to quarantine all scripts from the schools in the area to establish if there are any patterns.&nbsp; &ldquo;Teams from our national and provincial departments are working together with law enforcement agencies to get to the bottom of this matter so we can take appropriate action.&nbsp;&ldquo;This year, 677&thinsp;141 full-time and 150&thinsp;183 part-time candidates are sitting the examinations. Preparing for and managing an examination of this size is a huge task.&rdquo; Mhlanga said the department wanted to assure pupils, parents and others that extraordinary measures had been taken to protect the integrity of the exams. He said officials would work tirelessly to expose and charge those behind the leak of the exam paper.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will do everything possible to maintain high levels of security across the country and warn pupils not to take part in criminal acts.&nbsp; &ldquo;We appeal to pupils, parents and members of the community to report any incidents of papers being leaked and to expose those behind these acts.&rdquo;&nbsp; Last year, 15&thinsp;960 full-time and 1&thinsp;540 part-time candidates in Limpopo&rsquo;s Vhembe district had to rewrite their life science exam after the paper was leaked over WhatsApp. &nbsp;
