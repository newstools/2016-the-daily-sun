WITH so many close-ups on magazine covers, we wonder how models achieve such glowing complexions.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s how:&nbsp; - Using toner instead of facewash in the morning&nbsp; As mentioned in a PopSugar article, washing your face too often can cause more harm than good.

Create a mixture of castor oil and olive oil and you&rsquo;re good to go.&nbsp; - Keep your diet constant and lower your sugar intake&nbsp; You may have noticed that articles about health and skincare tips mention the negative effect sugar has on your body. It can cause premature aging, wrinkles and fine lines, according to experts.&nbsp; - Coconut oil is the answer to all your problems&nbsp; When you&rsquo;re either out of face care products or simply don&rsquo;t have them at hand, try grabbing some coconut oil.&nbsp; Coconut oil is a standby of natural living.
