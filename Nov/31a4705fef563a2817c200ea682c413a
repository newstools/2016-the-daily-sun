SINGLE women are being warned about a group of scammers targeting shoppers.Last week, cops in Lusikisiki bust five women between the ages of 30 and 35 after they allegedly robbed a widow of valuables worth R8&thinsp;000.Lusikisiki police spokesman Captain Mduduzi Godlwana said the women pretended to be makotis and wore black doeks and blankets. They approached female shoppers and offered them supermarket goods at half price.The women, believed to be from Mthatha, reportedly told their victims they worked at the shop and wanted to share their staff discount.They then lured their victims outside the shop, saying they were going to a storeroom. They told the victims to leave their bags and cellphones outside because there were metal detectors.They kept their victims&rsquo; belongings outside and when the victims finally realised the women had lied, they had already disappeared with their bags and phones. Godlwana said: &ldquo;We want people to stop looking for discounts and to ignore any unrealistic suggestions by strangers. These people are smart and target women. Recent victims have been widows and teachers.&rdquo;He said the women were arrested last week but were released on a warning by the Lusikisiki Magistrates Court. Godlwana said they travelled in a Toyota Avanza.&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be tempted by the thought of getting cheaper things. If you think you&rsquo;re being followed, try to get to a police station or to a security guard,&rdquo; said Godlwana.
