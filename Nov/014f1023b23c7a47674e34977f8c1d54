THE battle of the drains is raging in Red Location&rsquo;s RDP section of New Brighton kasi, Port Elizabeth.Residents claimed the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality doesn&rsquo;t react quickly enough to unblock overflowing drains.But the municipality complained that as soon as they fix one problem, another drain spills kak. It said residents keep flushing foreign objects like pads and nappies down toilets and drains. Residents of Mjunta Street yesterday reacted furiously when another blocked drain spewed its filth into their yards.Gogo Nokhanyiso Faku (69) said: &ldquo;We call the municipality all the time when the drains burst but they take their time to get here. &ldquo;If we call them today, they might only arrive the following day and still not do a good job.&rdquo;Gogo said the sewage not only flowed down the street but also into her house and those of her neighbours, posing health risks and damage to property. She had to dig a trench to re-direct the river of kak into the street.Gogo said the drain wars began when more people moved into the area in the late 1990s.&ldquo;The sewage and water gets into our homes and shacks, leaving a sickening smell. We will get sick and die from this. My whole body has been itching since the recent sewage bursts,&rdquo; said gogo.Melanie Gelderbloem, safety and support specialist for environmental management, said the sewage could be harmful to those exposed to it. &ldquo;It may happen that a person touches the sewage and then afterwards touches food they consume without washing their hands. This could lead to various types of diarrhoeal diseases or hepatitis.&rdquo;Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: &ldquo;Residents must work with us. They should stop throwing foreign objects down drains &ndash; that leads to blockages.&rdquo;
