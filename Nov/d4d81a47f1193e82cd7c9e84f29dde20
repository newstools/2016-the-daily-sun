LUKHOLO Badi (18) of Imveli Cycling Academy in Port Elizabeth wants to influence youths through sport.In 2014, he formed the academy and has attracted more than 80 young people, most of them under the age of 18.He told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I grew up with a passion for cycling but I could not afford to buy a bicycle. &ldquo;I used to watch cycling races on TV and wished that one day I would own a bicycle and be able to take part in the sport.&ldquo;My wishes were fulfilled after I got a job as a civil engineer. That is how I started to participate in the sport.&ldquo;I want to give youngsters a chance to live their dreams. &ldquo;Many young people in the kasi have nothing to do while some end up dealing in drugs and becoming criminals. &ldquo;Cycling is a demanding sport that needs power and concentration. &ldquo;This leaves little time for the boys to engage in bad behaviour,&rdquo; Lukholo said. He uses his own money to run the academy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a sponsor but my passion for the sport is the driving force behind this project. &ldquo;We target boys from the age of 10.&ldquo;These youngsters come from previously disadvantaged communities and most of the kids&rsquo; parents are unemployed,&rdquo; Lukholo said. Imveli Academy has satellite offices in Motherwell, Wells Estate, KwaZakele and KwaDwesi.Siphumeze Mhlana (19) of KwaDwesi said: &ldquo;Without the club I could have been locked up in prison a long time ago because I had bad friends. But cycling has changed my life.&rdquo;
