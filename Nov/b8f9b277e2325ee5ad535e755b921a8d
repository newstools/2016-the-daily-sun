&nbsp;The EFF says Co-operative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen is a "clown" for first dropping his application to interdict the release of the Public Protector's report into "state capture", only to reapply for it.&nbsp;"He is a clown who just wants to take advantage of the court proceedings... just to procrastinate time," EFF secretary general&nbsp;Godrich Gardee told reporters ahead of court proceedings on Tuesday.&nbsp;"We are hopeful the judiciary will see the frivolity of his conduct."Gardee also took aim at President Jacob Zuma and Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane for their applications.&nbsp;"We know the judiciary know him [Zuma] very well, [with]... his delaying tactics."&nbsp;Earlier, DA federal council chair James Self said he was confident the matter would go their way."We've got a very,good case. The Public Protector's report is very clear," he said.The DA was a complainant in the investigation by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela. It also made an application, along with other political parties including the EFF, to oppose the application for an interdict on the release of the report by Zuma, Van Rooyen and Zwane.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/van-rooyen-is-a-clown-eff-20161101
