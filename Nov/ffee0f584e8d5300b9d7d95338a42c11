When water began filling the dwelling, which is near the river, they climbed a tree.Chauke held on to his daughter. The mother was on another branch.&nbsp;"The branch broke and the child fell into the water. He tried for dear life to try and rescue his child, but she disappeared into the water," family spokesperson Richard Makondo said.&nbsp;He jumped into the water, but was forced to swim back without his daughter.&nbsp;"When he swam back to the tree where his wife was, he thought she was missing too," Makondo said.&nbsp;But she was still holding onto the tree.Radebe said the search would continue on Tuesday.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/rescuers-not-losing-hope-in-search-for-missing-girl-20161115
