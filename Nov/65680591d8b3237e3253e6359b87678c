AWARD-WINNING kwaito star, &ldquo;Professor&rdquo;, real name Mkhonzeni Langa, has allegedly put a stop to the release of DJ Happy Gal&rsquo;s music video.According to sources, Professor is angry that &ldquo;Happy Gal&rdquo;, real name Happiness Ndlovu, refused to give him 50% of the share for featuring in the song, Yaphel&rsquo;Imal Yam.Sunday Sun understands the video was shot three weeks ago and was launched at the famous Eyadini Lounge, in Umlazi, KZN, and was supposed to be on YouTube and other media platforms a week ago.One source said: &ldquo;He realised the song was well-received. When he did that feature, it was like he was doing her a favour as they had been friends for a long time. When he realised the views on YouTube were going up, he started making demands.&rdquo;Another source said: &ldquo;Everyone knows Professor wants to drop his own material, but he just lets people ask for features from him and now he&rsquo;s feeling the heat.&rdquo; Happy Gal said: &ldquo;The issue of the video is not true, we just submitted it to the media houses to playlist it.&rdquo;Professor said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been doing music for the past two decades. And there&rsquo;s no artist that can tell you I don&rsquo;t get along with them.&ldquo;The song is doing well and I&rsquo;m happy for my sister. Stop destroying us with hogwash stories.&rdquo;
