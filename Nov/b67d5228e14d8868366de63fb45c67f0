PUPILS at Makgobi Primary School burst into tears yesterday as the tiny coffins of two of their classmates were lowered into the ground. The two boys, Kitso (10) and Kgotla Serekiso (12), died on Monday after food poisoning from eating potato chips at their house in Makgobistad Village, outside Mahikeng in North West. Family member Ruth Gainewe said: &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t expected they would leave us so soon. We will remember their positive attitude towards life to heal our hearts. &ldquo;We would like to thank the education department and everyone who helped us during this difficult time.&rdquo;Monye Ncoane of the North West Department of Education said death was always a disaster to those left behind. &ldquo;We are not used to being in mourning at this time of the year as our kids are writing exams. Their classmates and teachers will need counselling.&rdquo; School principal Lesedi Modise said everyone had expected the boys to have a bright future. &ldquo;Kgotla was destined to become a lawyer as he was very inquisitive. Before he died, he wrote his name on a chalkboard at school in big letters. Maybe that was his way of saying farewell. &ldquo;Both boys were always in a good mood and eager to learn.&rdquo; The boys are survived by their mum Johanna, father Tebogo Mthue and younger sister Dintle (8).
