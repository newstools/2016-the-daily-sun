NEWLY launched political party People&rsquo;s Revolutionary Movement (PRM) is calling on the Minister of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba to provide a platform for discussion of same sex marriages.PRM national spokesman Nhlanhla Mhlongo told Daily Sun that the issue of same-sex relationships was a serious one that needed careful consideration. &ldquo;As a movement we are 100 percent against same-sex marriages. The movement stands for a normal society that consists of men and women.&rdquo; He said they saluted all the church leaders who observed God&rsquo;s commandments. &ldquo;We denounce those leaders who promote Sodom and Gomorrah in the land of our kings and queens.&rdquo;Speaking to party members at the official launch in Durban on Sunday, PRM president Nhlanhla Buthelezi said they valued the historic role played by the African kings, queens and all the traditional leaders. &ldquo;We will campaign for aggressive, vigorous and visible results of Operation Pakisa, so all illegal foreign nationals are repatriated to their countries.&rdquo;He called for free, quality education and a decolonised education system at all levels.He added that they also supported the move for South Africa to resign from the International Criminal Court. Sbongiseni Khumalo, programmes manager at the Durban Gay and Lesbian Community Health Centre said: &ldquo;We are all guided by the Constitution. We understand that everyone has their own opinions. But people should be careful in what they say because things like this can lead to hate crimes. It is only our sexual orientation that makes us different.&rdquo;Javu Baloyi, Commission for Gender Equality spokesman said that everyone had a right to their sexual preferences. Mayihlome Tshwete, spokesman for Home Affairs, said it was not the mandate of the department to create a platform for discussions.&ldquo;If they want to discuss the issue they can do it on their own.&rdquo;
