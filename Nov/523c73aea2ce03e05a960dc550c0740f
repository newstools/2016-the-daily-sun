THEY&rsquo;VE already been robbed and assaulted, but their attacker won&rsquo;t leave them alone.In fact, Anna Nhlapo (37) and her mum Lena Manyasha (54) share the same house with him.That&rsquo;s because Anna&rsquo;s 15-year-old son is allegedly addicted to drugs and won&rsquo;t stop terrorising them to get money!Anna, from Lotus Gardens, west of Tshwane, claimed her son is doing all kinds of drugs and that she and her mum fear for their lives.&ldquo;He fights with us to get money. He even steals valuables and cellphones and sells them to buy drugs,&rdquo; she claimed.She pleaded with SunReaders to help her son deal with his addiction.&ldquo;We tried to talk to him, but he says it&rsquo;s just the beginning. I don&rsquo;t feel safe alone with him because I fear that he might kill me.&rdquo; Anna said she discovered her son&rsquo;s addiction when he was arrested in 2013 for shoplifting. Since then his addiction has only worsened.Lena claimed he had become violent and that everyone in the house feared him. &ldquo;Whenever we try to talk sense into him, he threatens to kill us. When I refused to give him my phone, he hit me with his fists.&rdquo; Anna and her mum are asking for help to get him into a rehabilitation centre.
