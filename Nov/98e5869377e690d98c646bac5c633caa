MUMS are supposed to be loving and caring, but this 33-year-old abandoned her five children almost three weeks ago and left them without food! The kids, aged between three and 14, have been left in a dirty house and are forced to beg for food from passers-by. According to residents, the mum from Ngwanamatlang Village near Jane Furse moves from tavern to tavern with different men. Neighbour Micky Maila (45) said she realised last week that the kids were living on their own. This was when she saw the seven-year-old girl wasn&rsquo;t going to school as she was looking after her three-year-old sibling. &ldquo;The situation is shameful. When I saw the seven-year-old comforting the toddler, I couldn&rsquo;t hold back my tears. Soon all three of us were crying,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I help them out with food sometimes, but children need their parents for guidance to grow up properly.&rdquo; The 14-year-old child told the SunTeam that when his mum abandoned them, she left behind two loaves of bread. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t buy us food. Whenever she has groceries, she cooks at her friend&rsquo;s place while we starve. She never loved us but we love her,&rdquo; he said. Limpopo Social Development spokeswoman Adele van der Linde said they were not able to help the children because they were already receiving child support grants. Sassa Sekhukhune district manager Maphuthi Maphutuma said they were not aware of the matter but would investigate.&ldquo;We strongly condemn mothers abandoning their children and using their grant money for themselves,&rdquo; said Maphutuma.
