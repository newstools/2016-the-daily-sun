MINISTER of Basic Education Angie Motshekga said a few pupils who had access to the leaked matric mathematics paper have come forward. The education department was shocked by news that last Monday&rsquo;s exam had been leaked at Giyani High School in Limpopo. The leak was reportedly discovered by an invigilator after the exam was written. He noticed pupils had been studying a copy of the exam before they wrote it. It&rsquo;s believed a Gauteng pupil who is originally from Limpopo sent the paper to a pupil in Limpopo over WhatsApp. Motshekga said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m disappointed by this unfortunate incident.&rdquo;She said a task team had been assembled to ensure exams don&rsquo;t suffer further damage.Meanwhile, Giyani High School&rsquo;s governing body held a meeting on Friday with all matrics. Their parents defended them, saying they had received the paper over a WhatsApp study group without realising it was the leaked exam script. SGB member Edwin Chabalala said: &ldquo;Some pupils reported the leak to their teachers after the exam. &ldquo;Stop giving our children a bad name.&rdquo;
