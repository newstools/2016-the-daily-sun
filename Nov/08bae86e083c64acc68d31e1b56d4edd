WHILE some SunLanders are trying to work out where to get money to buy Christmas goodies, the Masinenge and Mtshali land claimants are smiling all the way to the bank.They have finally been compensated for their land claims. The department of land reform and rural development handed out cheques to the rightful owners who were forcefully moved from the area during the apartheid era.The event was held at Margate Hotel on the south coast of KZN last week.Mcebisi Skwatsha, deputy minister in the department, handed over cheques and vouchers amounting to over R9 million. The Masinenge land claimants were compensated with over R7,1 million while the Mtshalis and their neighbours received over R2 million.Skwatsha said: &ldquo;The Masinenge community was hastily removed from the land that their forefathers had occupied for many years, with beneficial occupational and grazing rights. &ldquo;The mass removals took place after 1977 and continued until 1984. A total of 64 households will benefit from the settlement of this claim.&rdquo;Skwatsha urged those who benefited to save money to send kids to school and to erect tombstones for those who had died before they were compensated.Ncamisile Ntombela (61), who spoke on behalf of the Mtshalis, said she was excited that the matter had finally been settled. She said they were accused of having used the money paid out by the department.&ldquo;Today our names are cleared because we were called names and accused of eating the money from the settlement. &ldquo;I would like to urge people not to speak about things that they&rsquo;re not sure of because today the truth has been revealed.&rdquo;Bongani Damane for the Masinenge community said he had suffered the same fate as Ncamisile, but was happy the truth was out now.
