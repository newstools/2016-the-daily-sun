SABC1&rsquo;S Gospel Gold presenter, Sthembile Mhlongo, has a bun in the oven.A source told Sunday Sun: &ldquo;Sthembile&rsquo;s been wanting to start a family for over two years now. That&rsquo;s why her previous affair with the young man didn&rsquo;t work out.&rdquo;Another source said they respect her for voicing her opinion about her needs and letting go of a man who wasn&rsquo;t willing to give her what she wanted.&ldquo;She&rsquo;s now dating someone who&rsquo;s mature and is ready to have kids.&ldquo;This is good although they&rsquo;re not married. They&rsquo;re adults and we hope they&rsquo;ll do the right thing eventually and tie the knot,&rdquo; said another source.Sthembile has kept a low profile since she took over the lucrative job of presenting one of the most respected gospel shows in Mzansi, Gospel Gold.Another source told Sunday Sun: &ldquo;She goes in, does her work and goes home. She&rsquo;s never been one to want to be an IT Girl as she&rsquo;s a very private person.&ldquo;This is working for her because no media is overly interested in her life, as she&rsquo;s seen as a boring character.&rdquo;Sthembile has survived the chop, while her male co-presenters keep getting changed.It&rsquo;s believed her ability to research, do voice-over work and direct location shoots, has made her one of the company&rsquo;s most valuable assets.She started working as a production runner and went on to learn from the best in the gospel industry, TV host, author and founder of the Crown Gospel Awards &ndash; Zanele Mbokazi-Magwaza.This week Sthe said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy about the pregnancy and it was planned.
