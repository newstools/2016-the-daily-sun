FOR FOUR hours, Shadrack clung desperately to the branches of a tree next to the raging river, his baby girl in his arms.But then the waters surged, the tree broke free from the soggy bank, and the screaming child was swept out of Shadrack&rsquo;s clutching hands.ALL THE MOURNING DAD IS LEFT WITH NOW IS THE MEMORY OF HIS CHILD&rsquo;S SCREAMS.Shadrack Chauke (31) told Daily Sun it was a wet and cold hell as he sat in the tree with his daughter, Evalady (3) and his wife Cynthia (28).&ldquo;When I saw the strong water coming, I knew my shack would be swept away,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I could not run to escape the strong moving water and I told my wife to climb into the tree. I joined her holding our daughter tightly to my chest.&rdquo;He said the rain kept on pounding down as they sat in the tree near their shack in Stjwetla squatter camp near Alexandra, Joburg.&ldquo;All I wanted was to save my family. I was worried. I hoped God would save us all.&rdquo;But the rain carried on, the Jukskei River rushing by at their feet. Shadrack saw many cars swept away in the river. He saw beds, fridges and other household items tumbling around in the river. At about 11pm, the tree they were sitting in broke free of the muddy ground and the branch he was sitting on broke. &ldquo;Evalady and I fell into the water. I reached for her but the water grabbed her from me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I still hear her crying. I tried to save her. I feel like I failed her.&rdquo;Shadrack crawled over the branches and reached the bank where he found his wife, but Evalady was gone.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if my daughter is alive or dead, but I want her back,&rdquo; he said.Heartbroken Cynthia said her daughter was the pillar of her happiness. &ldquo;She was always happy. She always asked me when we could go to the salon to change her hair style,&rdquo; said Cynthia.The heavy rain on Wednesday night cost many their belongings and some lost lives.
