SOME call him Madlizinsimbi, the one who eats iron, others call him Sondonzima, the strong man. This is because Masondo Ngubo (62), the man with the rubber body from Entukusweni near Cato Ridge, KZN can perform amazing acts without hurting himself.The SunTeam witnessed the madala bending iron rods with his neck, walking on light bulbs without breaking them and lifting a car engine with his teeth.Demonstrating his skills to pupils and teachers at Noxandu Primary School on Friday, Masondo was assisted by his wife Jemina Ngubo (49), his sons Ndabe Mabaso (34), Lucky Ngubo (39) and his granddaughter Dineo Selemula (6).Masondo also lay down with a cucumber placed on his stomach which Jemina cut in two with an axe without injuring her husband.Masondo told Daily Sun he started training for karate in 1970 and got his black belt in 1979.&ldquo;I realised my body was changing. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t feeling any pain and I thought I was sick.&ldquo;But doctors told me I was fine, so I went for advanced karate training so my body could do anything.&rdquo; Masondo insists he is not a magician.&ldquo;I was trained in what I&rsquo;m doing.&ldquo;I urge kids not to try what I do at home, school or any other place because they can get hurt,&rdquo; he said.Masondo wants to train the local youth to reduce crime and drug abuse through exercise, by taking care of their bodies and their minds.His neighbour Ntuthuko Gcumisa (52) said Masondo&rsquo;s tough body protects them from thugs.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so tough and strong, no thug can withstand him. I feel safe with him around,&rdquo; Ntuthuko said.
