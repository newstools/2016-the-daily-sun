PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma has accepted the resignation of two more SABC board members."President Jacob Zuma has received and accepted the resignations of Ms Vuyo Mhlakaza and Dr Aaron Tshidzumba as members of the board of the SABC, with immediate effect," the Presidency said in a statement."The president has thanked the two former board members for their contribution during their tenure at the SABC and wished them well in all their future endeavours."This means that the chairperson, Mbulaheni Maguvhe, is the only non-executive member.The board needs nine members to form a quorum. Without enough members to form a quorum, the board cannot make legally binding decisions.This comes as Parliament's ad hoc committee set up to look into the SABC board meets for the first time on Tuesday to discuss if the board is still fit to do its job.The ad hoc committee was appointed by Parliament. It has until January to decide on the board's future.Three board members resigned after former chief operations officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng was reinstated in a senior management role in September.On 5 October SABC board members Krish Naidoo and Vusi Mavuso announced their resignations at a meeting with Parliament's communications committee.Maguvhe has said he will not step down from his position, despite the inquiry, the SABC reported.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/zuma-accepts-sabc-board-resignations-20161115
