THERE&rsquo;S saying one rotten potato spoils the whole bag. A teacher apparently put the saying into practice on Friday when she allegedly caught one pupil cheating during exams and ended up chasing away the whole row where the pupil sat. The 13 grade 11 pupils from Wiggins High School in Mayville, Durban, who were affected by the teacher&rsquo;s decision claimed they have missed out on four final exam papers after their suspension. They said since then they were unable to write two economics papers, business studies and an English paper.The pupils said the teacher caught one pupil who kept looking at the wall during the exams and then realised that he was cheating as there were answers on the wall next to him.One of the pupils (17) said the teacher chased them out of the classroom before they could finish their economics paper. &ldquo;The teacher told us to return to school with R30 each for paint and said that we would paint the whole classroom.&rdquo;She said they each brought the R30 required on Monday but that the teacher still would not allow them to write their exams. Parent Ntombikayise Maphumulo (44), whose two kids were chased away, said she went to the school on Monday to address the matter with the teacher. She said the department of education should intervene. The SunTeam went to the school for comment but were referred to the department of education. Muzi Mahlambi, KZN education department spokesman, said they would engage with the district and investigate the matter urgently.&ldquo;We will recommend a re-write for the pupils. If the pupils are found to have cheated we will deal with them harshly.&rdquo;
