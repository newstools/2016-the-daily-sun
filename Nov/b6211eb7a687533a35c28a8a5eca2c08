THE court has warned teachers to stop believing everyone and falling for scammers who promise to make them millions from their pensions.The Mthatha Regional Court yesterday sentenced two Ugandan nationals to 15 years each for defrauding a pensioner of her money.Dennis Sserwadda (34) and Kufeero Stuart (34) were convicted on Tuesday. Magistrate Nonkonzo Xintolo said there were no compelling circumstances preventing the minimum prescribed sentence.Ssewrwadda, who runs a traditional healing shop in Mthatha as &ldquo;Dr Sserwadda&rdquo;, conned pensioner Virginia Mhlontlo (61) when she visited him in February last year.He promised her that if she cashed in all her pension and gave it to him, he would turn the money into millions.The woman who taught at Mhlontlo Primary School for over 40 years took R260 000 of her pension money, hoping to turn it into R6 million.Months went by. When the money did not materialise, she contacted Sserwadda who asked for another R15 000 to speed up the process.The trusting gogo, desperate to get her promised millions, borrowed from a mashonisa.Defence lawyer Zanemvula Nqoro tried to argue that Stuart fetched the money from the victim and did not know it was fraudulently obtained by Sserwadda, but the magistrate dismissed this claim.
