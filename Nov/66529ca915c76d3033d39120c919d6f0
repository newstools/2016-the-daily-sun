THE EFF wants President Jacob Zuma to either report corruption he admitted knowing about or face a criminal charge. The party said yesterday that Zuma must immediately report those he said he knew were stealing public funds.This comes after Zuma addressed an ANC forum in Pietermaritzburg, KZN and said: &ldquo;Those who say I am a thief are the worst thieves. &ldquo;Those are the thieves and I know they are stealing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just watching them. I know them.&rdquo; The EFF said the president has an obligation to report those who were doing crime. The party also urged SAA board chairwoman Dudu Myeni to name those she said are stealing.Myeni, answering questions during a parliamentary committee, said she knew and had knowledge of corrupt individuals stealing public funds.&ldquo;Jacob Zuma and Dudu Myeni must immediately report the people who are stealing public funds,&rdquo; read the EFF&rsquo;s statement. &ldquo;Otherwise, the EFF will lay charges against them for knowing of crime and not reporting it.&rdquo;It said their public pronouncement of knowledge of criminality, yet not reporting it, perpetuates distrust in the institutions of law and order.The statement said when a head of state publicly confesses to knowing of crimes and does not report them, it makes a culture of not reporting crimes and promotes criminality.The DA said in a statement it was irresponsible and illegal for a president to sit on information that relates to corruption and not take it to those empowered to investigate.&ldquo;But it comes as no surprise as president Zuma shows little understanding of the negative impact of corruption,&rdquo; the DA said.The party said it will ask investigators of a case it opened against Zuma to include this aspect in the probe.
