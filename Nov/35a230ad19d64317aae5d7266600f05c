THERE was no place more appropriate for world 400m record holder and Olympic champion, Wayde van Niekerk, to collect the SA Sports Star of the Year, Sportsman of the Year and 2016 Best Olympic Athlete awards than his favourite province of the Free State.The 200m and 400m sprinter got to collect his prizes at the &ldquo;home&rdquo; where he is much celebrated by the people, although Capetonians, in his place of birth, these days lay claim to him too.There was excitement and joy when the 24-year-old Van Niekerk, who obliterated Michael Johnson&rsquo;s 17-year-old standing 400m record of 43.18 to record a new one of 43.03, was called to the podium to collect his awards at the Sand du Plessis Theatre in Bloemfontein last night.This was the second year running the athlete won the Sports Star and Sportsman of the Year awards, having also collected more than R2 million and two Mercedes-Benz cars last year.This year the 400m Olympic champion beat Caster Semenya and cricketer Kagiso Rabada to win the highly contested Sports Star award.It wouldn&rsquo;t take too much to convince anyone that Van Niekerk deserves all the accolades and money coming his way, having also won the 400m African Championship title in Durban and the Diamond League challenge.Semenya, who also showed her competitors a clean pair of heels in the 800m at the Rio Olympics in Brazil, took home the Sportswoman of the Year award, beating Jenna Ward and Phumza Maweni to the crown.The 25-year-old Semenya achieved such feats this year under tremendous pressure, winning the 800m against a quality field.She also completed a hat-trick in Durban this year when she won the 800m, 1 500m and 4x400m titles &ndash; reclaiming her place among the world&rsquo;s best.Football fans are also happy. Mamelodi Sundowns bagged the Team of Year award for winning the 2015-16 PSL title and the Telkom Knockout.The&nbsp;Brazilians&nbsp;went on to claim the African Champions League title to become only the second South African team to win it after Orlando Pirates won it back in 1995. However,&nbsp;Downs&rsquo; African triumph falls outside of the September-to-September calendar year for award contention.Adjudicators chose&nbsp;Downs&nbsp;ahead of the men&rsquo;s coxless rowing pair and the Blitzbokke, who have also been a marvel to watch.Van Niekerk&rsquo;s coach, Ans Botha, took home the Coach of the Year award, beating&nbsp;Downs&rsquo; Pitso Mosimane, Jean Verster and Suzanne Ferreira.Charl du Toit won the Sportsman of the Year with Disability and the 2016 Best Paralympics Athlete awards, while Sportswoman of the Year with Disability went to Ilse Hayes.Blitzbokke star Seabelo Senatla shared the International Accomplishment crown with Brett Binder.Sportswoman of the year @caster800m @dailysunsa #izinjazegame #sasa16 pic.twitter.com/sAAaYd8mXM&mdash;
