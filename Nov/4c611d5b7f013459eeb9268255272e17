NOKUTHULA Zwane (19) is supposed to be preparing for her umembeso ceremony on 16 December.But Nokuthula, a Shembe church maiden, disappeared two weeks ago. Her worried mum, Bongeni Ngcamu (46), said her daughter accepted a marriage proposal after her fiance chose her in church. She told me they were already dating, so nobody forced her to accept his proposal. Eight cows were paid in July and she was very excited,&rdquo; said Bongeni.Mhlaliseni Hlatshwayo, a Shembe church spokesman from the Ebuhleni faction, said maidens are not forced to accept marriage proposals. &ldquo;In cases where a future bride changes her mind, decisions about lobola returns are made by the families.&rdquo; He said church rules indicate a woman must have accepted the proposal before being chosen in front of the congregation.KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed a missing person docket was opened at Ezibayeni Police Station. &ldquo;Anyone with the information is urged to contact Ezibayeni Police Station at 035 562 1072 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111.&rdquo;
