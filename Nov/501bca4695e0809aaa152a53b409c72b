&ldquo;CRIMINALS must just forget about doing their daily job this festive season, because the police will make sure that every South African citizen is safe.&ldquo;Thugs must do themselves a favour and hand themselves over to the cops.&rdquo; Those were the words of national acting police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane.He was speaking during the launch of the national safer festive season in KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga yesterday. Phahlane said the campaign aims to provide security to all citizens, especially those who will be getting bonuses at work and criminals will be after their money. He said cops will be visible in many crime hot spots and on the streets at night. &ldquo;&rsquo;We want to clamp down on crime this festive season and make South Africa safer. &ldquo;South Africans must be protected from criminals who will be eager to rob them of their belongings. We are going to increase police visibility in order to prevent crime.&ldquo;The SAPS and other law enforcement agencies will work together.&rdquo; Phahlane said they decided to visit the KwaMhlanga Taxi Rank because of the recent taxi violence and killings there. He said KwaMhlanga is not the only place affected by taxi violence. &ldquo;As the cops, we are giving the matter serious attention, so there will be no more killings happening here. &ldquo;Today we are going to sign a peace agreement to stop the violence that has been going on for months.&rdquo; He was accompanied by provincial police commissioner Mondli Zuma, safety MEC Pat Ngomane and police deputy minister Maggie Sotyu.
