JACOB Molele from Ferlie Village in Limpopo almost did not bury his wife, Maphuthi, as planned on Saturday. He was ordered to pay a R6 000 fine before he could bury her at a local cemetery in Moletjie. The village has two headmen, Ezekiel Meso and Geneva Selepe, who are fighting over who is the rightful ruler of the village. Jacob falls under Meso&rsquo;s council and that council is said not to have a cemetery, so Jacob was ordered to pay the fine on Friday.The cemetery is said to belong to Selepe, who claims to be the rightful leader. On Friday morning, when it was time for the elders to dig up a grave, they were met by community members outside the cemetery. They demanded a fine from them to gain access to the cemetery. Jacob is Meso&rsquo;s right-hand man and Selepe ordered Jacob to pay the money before burying his wife at the cemetery. &ldquo;He must pay the fine or find another cemetery where he can bury his wife.&ldquo;He must pay because he is a member of a group that does not want to be ruled by us. They are busy fighting us,&rdquo; said Selepe.When the SunTeam arrived at the cemetery on Friday, villagers had locked the gate and were sitting outside preventing Jacob and other elders from entering the place. Jacob told Daily Sun he has been living in the village for 25 years and has never paid a cent to bury a family member in the same cemetery. &ldquo;I buried my mother in-law in 2005 and I paid nothing. I have not been working with the Selepe council since 1999,&rdquo; said Jacob.Meso &ndash; who claims to be the rightful headman &ndash; didn&rsquo;t want Jacob to pay the money.But when all was said and done, Jacob paid the amount because he wanted to bury his wife on Saturday.
