THE brave headman died a hero, saving his chief from hitmen. But his selfless act saw him shot twice in the head as he wrestled an armed attacker. Now his family is without their breadwinner.But the local municipality and the ANC regional office have come to their aid, promising to look after the late Ndumiso Mzumbana&rsquo;s family in honour of his memory.This was announced on Saturday at the headman&rsquo;s funeral. Ndumiso also served as a ward committee member at Ngcolosi Village in Tsolo.The 44-year-old was shot dead by hitmen who opened fire in broad daylight during a meeting at Ngcolosi Great Place two weeks ago.Chief Bambelela &ldquo;Khabilanga&rdquo; Mbabama said he still couldn&rsquo;t believe Ndumiso died saving his life and added that he hoped police would apprehend the suspects soon.The chief&rsquo;s son, Malizole Mbabama, who also wrestled the two suspects, recalled the fateful day.&ldquo;Two young men arrived saying they wanted a piece of land and I told them to wait for my father. &ldquo;We were a bit suspicious because they spoke isiZulu. &ldquo;They took chairs and sat with us as my father was on the phone. Then one of the men bowed, pretending to be paying respect to the chief. &ldquo;But we were all shocked when he pulled a gun from under his cap and pointed it at my father.&ldquo;Ndumiso fought with him and he was shot twice in the head. My father was wounded in his right leg.&rdquo;They were both rushed to hospital, but Ndumiso died a few minutes later. Mayor Dywili said: &ldquo;We will give his family R10 000 to buy Christmas things and new school uniforms for next year. We will also find his wife a sustainable source of income so she can raise their two children.The chief said he suspected the motive behind the attack was a dispute over land and chieftaincy claims. The suspects are yet to be found.
