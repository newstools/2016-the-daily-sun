DO YOU get to a certain point during the month when you ask: &ldquo;Where did all my money go?&rdquo;These tips might help delay that moment.Track spendingKeep a money diary to track every cent you spend. You might discover ways to save.Look out for salesDon&rsquo;t buy when you want something. Wait for sales and go bargain-hunting for things you really need.Buy classic fashion piecesEven if you buy your Summer/Winter wardrobe on sale, you should still invest in classic fashion pieces that last, like a really beautiful leather jacket, a great coat, or a pair of boots that you know will last you for many seasons.This way you&rsquo;ll always have that one outfit staple to fall back on and you&rsquo;ll save money in the long run.Buy second-hand or do clothes swapsSome people participate in clothing swaps all the time.Save your changeAnd we don&rsquo;t mean at the bottom of your handbag, or in the ashtray in your car. We mean make an actual thing of it.Get a jar, give it a label (depending on whether you want to save some cash for a holiday or a new tattoo), and save all your spare change in there. It might take a while, but you&rsquo;ll slowly reach your goal and you&rsquo;ll know where all your money went!Make your own coffeeA cappuccino costs about R24 a cup, multiply that by five for every workday, then by about 48 for every work week and it totals R5 760. Rather invest in that jar of freeze dried coffee, or buy some beans and brew them yourself and you could save a thousand or two by the end of the year.Pack your own lunchLet&rsquo;s say your lunch costs about R50 per day. (We&rsquo;re being conservative though). That adds up to R12 000 per year, for what would most likely be a small lunch daily.Consider buying things to make lunch at work, or pack your own lunch every morning or the evening before.Stick to using cashSome people laugh at the idea of drawing money all the time and only spend it when you do the weekly shopping, instead of swiping a card. You&rsquo;ll find that using cash makes you a lot more conscious of how much cash you have at your disposal.It may be easier to swipe your card and not worry until you try to pay for that cappuccino &ndash; and your card gets declined.With cold, hard cash you can see how much you&rsquo;re spending in real time and be more aware of your spending habits.
