HE LONGS for a settled life with a woman to love and care for.But Jabulani has only known unhappiness in love and claims all his girlfriends were gold-diggers.Jabulani Vilane (32), from Lawley, south of Joburg said he&rsquo;s unlucky in love because he grew up without his parents. The sad man said women are only interested in his money.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had five lovers in my life and they all looked in my pockets rather than in my heart. I have lots of love to give but they didn&rsquo;t see that.&rdquo;Jabulani said his first relationship with a beautiful woman failed when she asked him to build a house for her parents at a village in the Eastern Cape. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a house of my own but live in a one-roomed shack, yet she made demands.&rdquo;He said she&rsquo;d want to see his payslips. Jabulani was single for a long time before he found another beautiful girlfriend. &ldquo;However, she kept asking me to take her to expensive restaurants where I couldn&rsquo;t afford the food.&rdquo; He said he never knew his mother.&ldquo;And my father left me in 1996 when I was just 12 years old,&rdquo; he said. Jabulani works as a security guard but said he finds it hard to keep jobs. &ldquo;I want my parents to come back to perform rituals so I can prosper in life.&rdquo;
