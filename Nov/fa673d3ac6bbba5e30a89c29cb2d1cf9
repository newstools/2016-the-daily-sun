He told the SunTeam cops handcuffed him and his wife on Tuesday night before beating them to a pulp and stealing their belongings. The 37-year-old man from Alberton, Ekurhuleni said cops knocked on his door at 11pm and said he and his wife were under arrest for assault. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t even know the person they alleged we assaulted,&rdquo; said Thomas. &ldquo;We have never been in a fight with anyone.&rdquo; Thomas said the cops handcuffed him and his wife and made them lie on the ground. A female and four male cops allegedly then took turns beating him. He said his six-month-pregnant wife was also beaten.&ldquo;We were then locked up at Alberton Police Station,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My wife was released the same night but I was taken to Palm Ridge Magistrates Court later. However, I was told to go home because there was no case against me.&rdquo; He said when he arrived home, his belongings had been thrown out of his house. Thomas said his computers, six beds, clothes, ID and various other valuable items disappeared. He went to open a case at Germiston Police Station after officers in Alberton wouldn&rsquo;t help him.Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubela said they were investigating a case of assault.
