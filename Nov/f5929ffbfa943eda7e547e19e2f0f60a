PETROS Mahlangu is an unhappy man.The 43-year-old from Marikana squatter camp, near Mabopane in Tshwane, told Daily Sun his wife, Fatima Mondlana (36) used muthi to drive him away. &ldquo;Voices speak to me in Shangaan and ask me if I want to die. I went to a sangoma who told me my wife was using muthi to chase me away so she could live with another man.&rdquo; Petros said he&rsquo;s had to sleep at a tavern twice because creatures were attacking him at home. &ldquo;My wife also changes into a snake or crawls like a monkey at night. Her hands become crooked. Sometimes I&rsquo;m attacked by things I can&rsquo;t even see.&ldquo;During the day she looks normal but at night she turns into a monster. However, I won&rsquo;t leave my home. The stand is in my name. She&rsquo;s a foreigner with no papers and now she wants to cheat me.&rdquo; The SunTeam spoke to Fatima Mondlana who admitted to having a lover. &ldquo;Petros is useless. That is why I have another man who gives me money.&rdquo; However, she denied changing into creatures to scare Petros.
