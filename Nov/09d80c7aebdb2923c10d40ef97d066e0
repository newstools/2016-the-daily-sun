INITIATION has officially been suspended in the Vaal.But, if local initiation school owners are to be believed, the initiations won&rsquo;t be stopped.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t run a gangster initiation school, I will continue to initiate boys, even this year,&rdquo; said Majantja Motloung, who has had an initiation school for 49 years.&ldquo;I have never produced a gangster or killed any boys in my camp. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why I can&rsquo;t to go ahead with the camp.&rdquo;With schoolkids finishing their academic year, the rush to go to the mountains is hotting up.While many chiefs around the country prepare for the journey to turn boys into men, this year&rsquo;s intake for the Vaal region has been suspended.The local forum for initiation by-laws together with the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities have postponed the initiations. The commission approved investigations that led to the suspension of intakes this year.This comes after unregistered initiation schools, initiate deaths at camps, violence, murders, rape and assaults, abductions and illegal occupation of land.The commission said it is worried about violence, murders, rapes and attacks that take place in the mountains, and has begun an investigation into issues regarding initiation schools in Gauteng. It said it found criminal elements have crept into the ritual.&ldquo;The current situation in the Sedibeng Municipality is not a true representation of the cultural practice of initiation rituals,&rdquo; it said.Brutal gang violence in the Vaal, like that recently reported between the Mopheme and the Diamonds gangs in the past two months, is allegedly linked to initiation.
