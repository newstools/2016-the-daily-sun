HIS WIFE disappeared two months ago.Joseph Machaile (45) from Orlando East, Soweto keeps getting SMSes from strangers that say that his wife Clara Ubisse (34) is dead somewhere in Tshwane.But the stranger doesn&rsquo;t say where the body can be found.Two weeks ago, he tried to call the number on the SMS but it went straight to voicemail.The frustrated father of two said he doesn&rsquo;t know what to do.&ldquo;My wife is sick and I know she wants to come home, wherever she is,&rdquo; said Joseph.He said his wife has womb cancer and she&rsquo;s a private person who wouldn&rsquo;t leave her children.He believes she&rsquo;s been kidnapped.Joseph said the other day someone called and gave his wife the phone.&ldquo;I spoke to her and while I was trying to find out where she was, the person who gave her the phone grabbed it from her and told me they want money to release her.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how much they want because they never disclose it. I&rsquo;m worried sick. I can&rsquo;t sleep at night because my children are always crying for her.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she wants to come home but she doesn&rsquo;t know how to escape from her kidnappers. &ldquo;I sometimes think maybe they have killed her and I may find her body in a mortuary.&rdquo;Joseph said he has been through mortuaries and hospitals in Tshwane looking for Clara but she&rsquo;s nowhere to be found.He has reported the terrible situation to police in Tshwane but he&rsquo;s not getting any help.&ldquo;I showed them the SMSes but still they&rsquo;re not doing anything. I&rsquo;m stressed,&rdquo; he said.Police at Pretoria West said they have opened a missing person&rsquo;s case and are investigating.
