THE DISGRUNTLED ANC members from parts of Waterberg region forced themselves in to the party&rsquo;s Frans Mohlala House on Monday apparently crying foul of their membership audits. Some members were allegedly beaten and some membership forms were destroyed during the chaos.They claimed to have passed the audit in their branches but some disputes were lodged to the provincial office and that caused branch members to be at loggerheads. Some members claim that the ANC provincial secretary Nocks Seabi is dividing the branches favoring his friends. Some of them said they fear to be purged from their leadership positions if they can be seen talking to the media.&ldquo;Waterberg region branches went to Frans Mohlala house to seek answers of why our branches are disputed by ghosts while we received reports that we passed audit. We want to know from the provincial office how possible can this be that people from nowhere can disputed clean branches and we want to know the people who disputed our branches,&rdquo; said Chairperson of one branch in Waterberg.However, the actions by the regional members did not sit well with the party&rsquo;s youth league in the province. Secretary of the League Che Selane said the party must investigate the person who paid the transportation of the members who stomped in the Frans Mohlala offices.&ldquo;It is quite disturbing that these people mostly women are allegedly demonstration at our offices in support of the regional secretary of Waterberg whom we have since asked the ANC in the province to deal with his matter and to this date the man is still in office. In fact, he was seen addressing them after his court appearance in Mokopane,&rdquo; said Selane.The youth league is threatening to write a letter to ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe to charge the officials of the party in the province for deliberately stalling to implement the decision of the provincial Executive Council of the party, which was to ask the regional secretary of Waterberg who is facing charges of rape and bribery to step aside.ANC Spokesman in Limpopo Aluwani Netshianda said the members are indeed complaining about their membership audit. He stated that the provincial office is busy addressing all the complaints received from the branches.&ldquo;There are few branches who have made inquiries about some outstanding issues as regards the audit from Waterberg. Our leadership, auditors and branch representatives are working together to resolve the few outstanding issues,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
