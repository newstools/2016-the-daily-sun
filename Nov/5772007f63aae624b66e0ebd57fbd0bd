A NEW acting king of Abathembu has been coronated. This despite a dark cloud hanging over the troubled nation.On Friday, hours before Prince Azenathi Dalidyebo was installed, his arch rival, Chief Lindikhaya Daludumo Mtirara, had allegedly killed himself in his Lyttelton home in Pretoria.Accord-ing to police, the 51-year-old brigadier-general at the South African National Defence Force was found by relatives on his bed, with a bullet wound to his upper body and the gun near him.Back in Bumbane Great Place, 24-year-old university student Azenathi&rsquo;s coronation was under way. It was attended by 1 000 people, but no government officials had pitched despite being invited.The acting king was reminded he would have to step down if his dad was released from custody. This was so he could continue where he had left off before his arrest in December 2015.Messages of support poured in, including one from Inkatha Freedom Party&rsquo;s Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who encouraged Azenathi to unite the Thembu nation.
