ANTARA Aligusif (36) is a wanted man, but it is not the law that is after him.The Ghanaian man from Philippi said a local holy man&rsquo;s prophecy revealed that an unknown woman wants him dead. But he gave it no thought.That was until he got home and found an evil chicken of death waiting at his front door!The evil fowl had a red ribbon tied to it along with a small coffin with a white cross painted on it and two horns.Antara said he got the shock of his life when the prophet&rsquo;s warnings proved to be true.&ldquo;He told me he had a prophecy in which a woman said she wanted to hurt me. &ldquo;I ignored it as I didn&rsquo;t have any argument or feud with any woman.&rdquo; When he arrived at his shipping container on Friday morning where he lives and makes burglar bars and sliding doors for a living, he saw a group of people standing in front of it. &ldquo;I also saw a board with a message that read &lsquo;Nine b agama tare da ka wannan ne kawai da farko&rsquo; (I am not finished with you, this is just the beginning).&rdquo; He immediately called Pastor Leegan Muguru to witness this prophecy! The pastor sprinkled holy water over the chicken and muthi, grabbed it and quickly chucked it in a bag.&ldquo;I have given Antara many warnings. He needs to pray to fight off the evil woman who wants to destroy his life.&rdquo; The pastor took the chicken and muthi to Monwabisi Beach near Khayelitsha, where it was burned. Sangoma Duduzile Dungeni from Khayamandi in Stellenbosch said Antara was in serious trouble. &ldquo;Horns and a coffin mean no good. They want him dead and nothing else. He must consult a strong sangoma to cleanse him and the place where the muthi was found.&rdquo;
