STUDENTS&rsquo; emotions were high as they marched to UJ&rsquo;s Kings&shy;way campus in Auckland Park, Joburg yesterday to deliver a memorandum to vice-chancellor Ihron van Rensburg.The march was sparked by the death of a student shot dead early on Saturday morning at UJ accredited accommodation off campus. Kelvin Baloyi (21) was doing his first year in computer sciences and Informatics. According to a statement, a security guard fled the scene soon after the incident happened. Student leader Lindokuhle Xulu said the students have had enough of being abused by the professor and his bouncers.&ldquo;These men are uncontrollable and think they are gods. They harass and treat us like thieves. &ldquo;Van Rensburg is a killer because if he didn&rsquo;t bring these bouncers to bully us we wouldn&rsquo;t have lost a life,&rdquo; said Lindokuhle.Police blocked the students from getting closer to the university. They allegedly were told if they forced their way there, they would be shot at.Student Wandile Pienaar (24), holding a poster that read &ldquo;Bouncers must Bounce&rdquo;, claimed that many cases against them have been swept under the carpet. &ldquo;They behave like we are terrorists out to get them, yet they are the ones who bring terror to us,&rdquo; said Wandile.Professor Itumeleng Mosala of the Azanian People&rsquo;s Organisation went to speak to Rensburg about the students&rsquo; demands since they were told to stay 100 metres from the campus.UJ spokesman Kaamini Reddy said police were investigating the circumstances surrounding Saturday&rsquo;s incident. She said it was difficult to say what had happened because it was outside of university hours and off campus. &ldquo;There is speculation that the guard was employed by the university but this is not true. &ldquo;We send our deepest condolences to the family,&rdquo; said Reddy.
