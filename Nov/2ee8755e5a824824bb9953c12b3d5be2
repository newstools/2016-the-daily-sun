PSL coaches Gavin Hunt and Gordon Igesund have wished Bafana Bafana well ahead of their Fifa 2018 World Cup qualifier against Senegal at Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane on tomorrow.South Africa go into their second game with one point to their name after they drew with Burkina Faso away. Their qualification chances could be badly dented should they lose to the Lions of Teranga tomorrow. Former Bafana mentor Igesund said it was vital for coach Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba&rsquo;s charges to win their home matches to stand a good chance of going to Russia. The Highlands Park coach was speaking yesterday at the Gauteng Champion of Champions media briefing for the tournament set for Sunday at Tsakane Stadium. Bidvest Wits and defending champions SuperSport United are also involved. The class of 2000 Olympic Games team will face off with Ekurhuleni Legends, featuring players such as Jabulani Mendu and Pollen Ndlanya, in a curtain-raiser. The competition aims to raise funds for three charity organisations chosen by the respective teams. Said Igesund: &ldquo;We all need to get behind Bafana. It&rsquo;s not going to be an easy game, I can tell you right now. But I know we are capable. Bafana beat Spain 1-0 here when they were the European champions. &ldquo;Good luck to them, I wish them well.&rdquo; He added that he would have loved to see the Netherlands born Lars Veldwijk, who could be getting his first cap tomorrow, play in a few matches before the important qualifier. &ldquo;I would have loved to see the new boy from the Netherlands play maybe one or two friendlies before getting thrown in at the deep end, but unfortunately it wasn&rsquo;t to be. It&rsquo;s difficult for a new player to come in but obviously Shakes will have to make that call,&rdquo; he added. Hunt is optimistic that Bafana will get the result: &ldquo;I wish them well. I am sure they will do well on Saturday.&rdquo;
