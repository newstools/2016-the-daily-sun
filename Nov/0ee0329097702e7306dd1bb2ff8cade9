THE unsuspecting Ben 10 Asenathi got the fright of his life when he went into a toilet and saw a strange &ldquo;gift&rdquo; there. When he saw some cookies and the message that came with them, he knew immediately who left them. &ldquo;EAT CHEATER,&rdquo; THE NOTE SAID! &ldquo;That note told me who the sender was,&rdquo; said Asenathi Marhwanqana, of Ntlekiseni Location in Mthatha, Eastern Cape.On Tuesday, Asenathi&rsquo;s 21st birthday, he went to the toilet in the morning and was greeted there by four home-baked cookies on a white plate and the red note in front of the toilet seat. &ldquo;It was a scary present from the 58-year-old sugar mama I have been dating for the past two weeks.&rdquo; Asenathi said that it was the demanding behaviour of his gogo lover that made him end the relationship after only a fortnight. &ldquo;She demanded to be poked five times a day,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That was hard on me. She is too tall and too fat.&rdquo; He said the sugar mama also wanted him to use her photo as his profile picture on social networks &ndash; and she insisted on being by his side all the time. He said the sugar mama bought him a skorokoro Nissan Bakkie and also a new shack, but he gave them back to her when they broke up. &ldquo;She has been threatening to use muthi to kill me and my new girlfriend if I do not come back to her. &ldquo;She even said she will send tokoloshes to come and bite my 4-5 until it looks like a sausage,&rdquo; said Asenathi. &ldquo;I am terrified, but I have a strong sangoma on my side.&rdquo; The gogo, who did not want to be named, admitted that she placed the cookies on Asenathi&rsquo;s toilet on his birthday, but said she did it out of love. &ldquo;I love him a lot and he pokes me so good, I cannot lose him. I am using muthi to bring him back, but it is difficult because I know that he is also consulting his own sangoma to fight me,&rdquo; said the gogo, who is the owner of a chesa nyama. &ldquo;This is a battle for love and if we cannot get back together, then one of us has to die.&rdquo; She said the cookies contained korobela, and she was disappointed that Asenathi took not even one bite. Asenathi said he would not open a case with the police but would rather fight back against the gogo by also using muthi.
