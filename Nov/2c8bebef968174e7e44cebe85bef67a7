EAST London residents now get free Wi-Fi connection at their central library.Buffalo City executive mayor Xola Pakati officially launched the project on Friday.Library users will receive 50 megabytes of data to connect to the internet on their smartphones and laptops. A desktop will also be made available for people who do not have a device.Pakati told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We decided to supply Wi-Fi in the library because most people who want information visit the library. &ldquo;This connection is going to help a lot of schoolkids who need to do research for their studies. &ldquo;Technology is very important these days because the information in books is not always quite up to date.&ldquo;Now when you want information that you cannot find in books, you just have to log in to the internet and do a search,&rdquo; said Pakati.East London Science College pupil Khanyolwethu Ngcayi (13) said she is over the moon.&ldquo;Now we do not have to buy airtime or bundles in order to get internet access.&ldquo;The situation was very difficult for some pupils because not all parents can afford to buy airtime or data bundles.&rdquo; Another pupil, Mbali Gcani (14), told Daily Sun she never thought that one day she would have access to free Wi-Fi. &ldquo;I am very happy because this is going to help us a lot when we do our school projects,&rdquo; said Mbali. The free Wi-Fi service will also be available at the King William&rsquo;s Town library.
