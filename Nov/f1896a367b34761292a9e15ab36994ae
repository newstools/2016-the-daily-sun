The ANC has hailed its meeting with veterans in the party as a step in the right direction while&nbsp;at the same time slamming those involved in the Save South Africa campaign."That's why we are proud of the group we are meeting, [it is] very legit [and they] don't make grand statements about the challenges of the ANC. They are meeting the ANC," the party's spokesperson Zizi Kodwa told journalists on Friday.He was speaking on the sidelines of the party's second meeting with representatives of the ANC's 129 stalwarts who have been calling for a consultative conference.Former leaders in the ANC, including the three remaining Rivonia trialists, former ministers and heads of missions, had expressed concern over the trajectory of the nearly 105-year-old political party.They said they wanted the organisation to renew itself and recommit itself to the rediscovering the principles of the liberation movement.Kodwa said the current leaders of the ANC wanted to meet over issues raised by the stalwarts urgently because the party viewed matters raised in the report&nbsp;For the Sake of Our Future&nbsp;as serious.He said the party had no intention of holding marathon meetings without tangible results."We think coming out of this meeting there will be a concrete programme of action, even if it's a minimum programme to deal with issues that have to do with the unity of the ANC, to do with the health and the state of the ANC," said Kodwa.White monopoly capitalHe said the party did not dismiss the veterans' calls for a consultative conference but instead wanted to hear how their proposal would help the ANC.Kodwa, however, had different views on another longstanding member and those involved in a campaign to rid South Africa of Jacob Zuma as president.The national spokesperson of the ANC said based on initial remarks made by Sipho Pityana, a&nbsp;Save South Africa member and chairperson of the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution,&nbsp;about the state of the ruling party, he did not care about the ANC as the party previously believed.Focusing on how the group was constituted,&nbsp;Kodwa said&nbsp;Save South Africa&nbsp;represented white monopoly capital and was likely to fall flat on its face.Kodwa also said he believed calls being made by the group, including that of an end to a Zuma presidency, were possibly part of plan to launch a political organisation."Look at the breakaway of the PAC, the breakaway of the group of 8, [Forum 4 Service Delivery] in Rustenburg, these are cadres from the ANC, so clearly we can see where Pityana's group is going," he said.Kodwa said there was nothing new about what Save South Africa&nbsp;was attempting to achieve.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/save-south-africa-will-fall-flat-on-its-face-anc-20161125
