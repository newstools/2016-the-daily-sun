Mahlangu cruised to a time of 23.77 seconds and was only beaten to the finish line by the Brit, Richard Whitehead (23.39).Last month the young blade runner was recognised by Gauteng when he won the award for 2016 Sportsman of the Year with a Disability. And on Sunday, at the biggest sports event in Mzansi , Mahlangu was honoured again alongside SA superstars Wayde van Niekerk and Caster Semenya.He said: “The biggest thing I have done for my life is to enjoy what I do for a living. The medal truly comes second. It’s always about enjoying the race – the rest is history.”
