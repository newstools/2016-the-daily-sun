ANGRY, worried parents have taken to walking their uncircumcised boys to school in the morning and walking them home again in the afternoon.This is because the boys, some of them as young as 14, from Mtsheko Village, Lady Frere, Eastern Cape have been threatened by a gang of youths, apparently because they haven&rsquo;t been circumcised.While they were walking to school, the gang would threaten to moer them with knobkerries and shout insults at them about being boys around men.The gang&rsquo;s threats got worse over the weekend when a teenager&rsquo;s family house was broken into.Luvuyo Mgunyana (18) said he was asleep when he heard shouting and banging on the door.&ldquo;I knew who they were and that they wanted me.&rdquo; He said he managed to run away to a neighbour&rsquo;s house. Luvuyo&rsquo;s angry mum said it has been a painful week in the village.&ldquo;The boys are scared. We don&rsquo;t understand what demons make these older boys want to ruin our children&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo; The gang allegedly threatened to show the schoolboys how real men look and act. She said the gang members have been arrested before but are always released.Mthuthuzeli Kwababa, the village headman, confirmed that angry residents asked him to call the cops on Sunday.&ldquo;The police station is not far from us at all. We wish they could have arrived here sooner than the eight hours they took.&rdquo; He said they needed more action from police because law-abiding citizens were fast running out of patience with the young thugs.&ldquo;We hope that now a case has been opened by the Mgunyana family these youths will be locked up.&rdquo; Captain Namhla Mdleleni, a police spokeswoman, confirmed that a case of attempted housebreaking was opened and that arrests would take place soon.
