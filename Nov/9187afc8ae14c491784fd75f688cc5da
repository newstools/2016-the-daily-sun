&ldquo;Feelin Alright&rdquo;, the video, out now, captures the joy of exploring and playful adventure, it&rsquo;s the feeling of sunshine, of young love. &nbsp; Directed and edited by CAPSO, the video infuses a fresh African flavor with the fun colourful world of Pop Music. The fashion also stays true to this vision with striking leather and vibrant pieces. &ldquo;I want youth to see there is more than money, guns and arrogance to music, it&rsquo;s about feeling alright, liberating who you are. Be happy, live the summer,&rdquo; said CAPSO. &nbsp; The single was produced and recorded in Sweden, Johannesburg and New York and the video was filmed in Cape Town. CAPSO wanted to portray this global identity that the track has inherited and make sure that it came through on the screen.
