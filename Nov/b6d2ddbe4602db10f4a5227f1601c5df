A DRAMATIC kidnapping at TLC Children&rsquo;s Home in the early hours of yesterday morning was like something out of a movie. Thugs dressed as paramedics stormed into the home in Eikenhof, Ekurhuleni, and grabbed four orphans between the ages of 18 and 20 before fleeing the scene with them! Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant Kay Makhubela said the seven armed kidnappers earlier hijacked an ambulance after calling to say a woman was in labour.They handcuffed the paramedics, put them in the back of their ambulance and stripped off their clothing, which they then put on themselves.&ldquo;Paramedics received a call about a woman in labour at the orphanage.&ldquo;On their way to the scene, they were hijacked and robbed at gunpoint. &ldquo;The thugs then went to the children&rsquo;s home in the ambulance and held up the guard at gunpoint and put him into the vehicle. After they had left with the hostages, a local police car on patrol noticed the ambulance was driving strangely and followed it. &ldquo;There was a shoot-out and police managed to rescue the hostages, security guard and paramedics.&rdquo; Makhubela said the suspects are still at large and no arrests had been made so far. But cases of kidnapping, hijacking and armed robbery were opened. Emergency Management Services spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said the two paramedics sustained minor injuries. Meanwhile, seven men accused of kidnapping and gang raping a 13-year-old girl were arrested on Wednesday. Western Cape police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said they were still hunting another man suspected to have been involved in the attack in Nyanga, Cape Town on Friday night. He said the girl had been walking alone at around 8pm when she was taken to a shack by a group of men and repeatedly raped. The suspects will appear in the Wynberg Magistrates Court today.
