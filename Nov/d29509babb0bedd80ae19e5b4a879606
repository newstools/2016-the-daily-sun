APOLOGIES have been the order of the day at SA Rugby this weekend, thanks to the Springboks.And who wouldn&rsquo;t apologise to their loyal supporters following such a pathetic season of poor rugby?Springbok coach Allister Coetzee headed the list of apologies, followed by his captain Adriaan Strauss and Saru president Mark Alexander.The trio had no choice but to face up to their demons and say &ldquo;sorry&rdquo; after Saturday&rsquo;s unexpected 20-18 loss to Italy in Florence.Just last week they slumped to a 37-21 defeat to England in Twickenham, which came after a heartbreaking 31-31 draw with the Barbarians at the Wembley Stadium in London a fortnight ago.Coetzee described Saturday&rsquo;s defeat as the darkest moment of his coaching career, while he also congratulated Italy on their historic win.It was the first time in 13 matches that Italy defeated the Boks.&ldquo;No disrespect to Italy, but it&rsquo;s not good enough for the Springboks to lose to Italy,&rdquo; said Coetzee. &ldquo;Compared to us, they played without any pressure on them while we looked like a team that lacked self-belief and had a fear of failure.&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to look at it emotionally now, because emotions are running high.&rdquo;Skipper Strauss said the team was very disappointed by the performance against Italy. He said: &ldquo;We are not going to offer any excuses, what happened today was not worthy of what we stand for as a team and as a rugby playing country. We are in a dark place at the moment and we must get ourselves out of it.&rdquo; Alexander released a statement admitting that the whole country is extremely disappointed with this year&rsquo;s Springbok results &ldquo;and deeply worrying aspects of the performances&rdquo;. It has not been good enough and no one is pretending otherwise: &ldquo;We have a minimum target of winning three out of four Test matches each season &ndash; which is better than the historical record &ndash; but we have not come close this season.&ldquo;It would be easy to lay the blame for that at one door or another and look for scapegoats, but it would also be an oversimplification.&ldquo;All of us within South African rugby need to look at ourselves and ask what we could have done differently in aid of the Springbok cause.&ldquo;Those questions will be asked at the end of the season when we will undertake a full review of the year and what new interventions may be needed to turn things around.&ldquo;No group of individuals is more concerned or disappointed right now than the Springbok team and management,&rdquo; said Alexander.&ldquo;After that it is our job to take steps to do as much as we possibly can to make sure we are not in a similar position in 12 months&rsquo; time. &ldquo;Our focus is on solutions and finding answers to our current problems.&ldquo;We have a Test against Wales on Saturday (at Millennium Stadium), then we will review the season and spend time determining a path for the future.&rdquo;
