TIMOTHY Masini was a good cop for 10 years. But then he allegedly took a bribe &ndash; and lost everything!Masini allegedly took R100 bribe from a man who later reported him to his seniors.&ldquo;I lost my job as a police officer. My last resort is to drive taxis just to survive.&rdquo;&ldquo;My life is a mess. I was taken into custody for four days without appearing in court and was later released. I opened a case against the State which is still pending.&rdquo;Masini told Daily Sun he served as a cop for 10 years and had been due for a promotion this year. &ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;m losing my mind! I was suspended without pay and my request for an appeal has not been responded to since August.&rdquo;Masini said this has greatly affected his family as he can no longer provide for them. &ldquo;I have had to negotiate with their transport driver and school because I cannot afford to pay school and transport fees any more.&rdquo;His wife has even opted to go back home with their kids including a one-month-old baby as they would sometimes have no food to eat.&ldquo;I desperately need my job back. What kind of a man fails to buy bread for his children?&rdquo;Captain Kay Makhubela confirmed that Masini was suspended on charges of corruption and that this was the only case against him since he started working as a police officer.
