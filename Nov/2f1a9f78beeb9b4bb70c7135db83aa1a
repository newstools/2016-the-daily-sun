A TWELVE-YEAR-OLD boy dreads the thought of going to school for fear of being victimised because of his haircut. This is after his teacher allegedly cut a shape in his hair which resembles a star. Thuthukani Ndwandwe, a grade 6 pupil at Mcopheleli Primary School in KwaDabeka, west of Durban, said he has become a laughing stock.His fuming mum Nontethelelo (42) said her son is forced to wear a beanie in the scorching heat. &ldquo;Two weeks ago I had to beg him to go to school because he was refusing,&rdquo; said Nontethelelo.According to his mum, Thuthukani&rsquo;s isiZulu teacher allegedly questioned the cleanliness of his hair.She cut some off as a way to force him to cut the rest off. When that did not yield any results, the teacher cut the shape of a star in his hair. &ldquo;Our religion does not allow us to shave our hair. &ldquo;We expect everyone to respect that. &ldquo;The teacher should have called me and my husband so we could explain why he could not cut his hair.&rdquo; Nontethelelo said she has since opened a case against the teacher. &ldquo;Now the vice-principal has criticised me for doing that.&rdquo;KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said cops are investigating a case of common assault. Shembe priest Thabo Sambothi from Philangezwi Temple said the matter was reported to the church.Two weeks ago, Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva, chairwoman of the Commission for the Protection of the Rights of Religious Communities, said they were working with the department of education to stop discrimination of Shembe pupils at schools.She said letters would be sent to two schools in Jozini where similar incidents had occurred.KZN Education Department spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said: &ldquo;The department acknowledges that our country has individuals who belong to different religions. We expect our employees to remember that. The department will investigate the matter.&rdquo;
