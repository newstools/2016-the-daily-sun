SINGER Judith Sephuma is said to be slowly cutting all ties with her ex-husband, Siphiwe Mhlambi.In a post on social media, she wrote about &ldquo;getting a new photographer&rdquo;. A showbiz source said: &ldquo;When she was with Siphiwe, who is a photographer, all her professional pictures were taken by him. The post proves she&rsquo;s slowly moving along.&rdquo; Another source said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they still communicate because of the kids. &ldquo;But imagine how awkward it would be for Judith to pay him for photographic services!&rdquo; Judith was married to Siphiwe for over a decade, and news of their divorce only recently came to light. But it&rsquo;s believed the divorce took place a while ago. When Sunday Sun tried to contact Judith, she didn&rsquo;t answer our calls. Her publicist, Kgomotso Modise, said: &ldquo;Siphiwe is still her official photographer. &ldquo;All other service providers and the new photographer in question are freelance, as required for specific purposes.&rdquo;But Siphiwe sings quite a different tune. When we asked him about Judith, he declared: &ldquo;I no longer work with her.&rdquo;
