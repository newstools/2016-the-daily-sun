THULI Madonsela has ruled out ever going into politics again. The former Public Protector, who used to call the ANC her political home, said she would prefer to stay above politics in the future. She would, however, be available to assist any political party that might need her services. It is not clear what kind of services she has in mind, but she gave a simple &ldquo;no&rdquo; as a reply when journalists asked her about her political ambitions, on the sidelines of the Mahatma Gandhi Awards in Durban on Monday night.&ldquo;I was a member of the ANC and I left in 2007, not because I had any bad feelings, but professionally I thought I needed to distance myself from politics and I am still in that space,&rdquo; she said.Madonsela has had a stormy relationship with her former comrades since she took office. The relationship soured when she released the Nkandla report, after which she was personally attacked by ANC MPs and other structures.As recently as last week, ANC MPs voted against an EFF motion to have her address a joint sitting of Parliament to bid them farewell.This came after she released the State Capture report, which found evidence that President Jacob Zuma may have had an improper relationship with the Gupta family. In her remedial findings she recommended that Zuma establish a judicial commission of inquiry to further probe allegations of state capture by the Guptas.
