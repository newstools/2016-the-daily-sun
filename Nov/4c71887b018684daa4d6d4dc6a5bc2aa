MUSAWENKOSI Zakwe has opened a case against the deputy mayor of Okhahlamba Municipality. &ldquo;I fear for my life because I don&rsquo;t know what I have done to her to threaten me with death,&rdquo; said Zakwe (43) of Emoyeni in Bergville.A case of assault was opened on Tuesday at the Bergville cop shop. Zakwe claimed deputy mayor Thabile Ngozo, who is also a ward councillor, allegedly told him she would send her hitmen to kill him. Ngozo won the ward which Zakwe contested as an independent candidate in August. Zakwe said he went to get proof of residence at the councillor&rsquo;s office on Friday for banking purposes. &ldquo;The lady at reception was busy. The councillor walked in and asked me what I was doing in the ANC offices.&ldquo;She started humiliating me and wagging her finger in my face, saying she will send her hitmen after me,&rdquo; he said. Ngozo said Zakwe was lying. &ldquo;I never said those things. This is a political trick. Please don&rsquo;t call me again,&rdquo; she said. Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that a case of intimidation has been opened for investigation.&ldquo;A 43-year-old man was allegedly threatened with his life. No arrest has been made,&rdquo; said Gwala.
