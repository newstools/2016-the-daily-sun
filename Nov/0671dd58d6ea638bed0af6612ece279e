Who are you? We don&rsquo;t know you in the struggle,&rdquo; he said in Newcastle on Monday, after his appearance in court on charges related to comments he made about occupying land.Malema has been charged with contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956, following statements he made at the party's elective conference in Bloemfontein in 2014 and in Newcastle in June this year. Civil rights group AfriForum laid the charges.Umkhonto We Sizwe Military Veterans Association chairperson Kebby Maphatsoe recently criticised a group of over 100 ANC veterans for publically expressing concerns about President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s leadership and the state of the ruling party. Zuma&rsquo;s tenure at the helm of the ANC comes to an end in December 2017.Malema referred to Maphatsoe as &ldquo;Minister Maponapona&rdquo; because of a photo of a naked, one-armed man in a hotel room which was circulated on social media last week. Some believe that Maphatsoe is the man in the photo.Malema said those speaking out and raising concerns about developments in the ANC are being targeted.&ldquo;People who sacrificed their lives for this democracy, they are saying there is something wrong, can you correct it? But they are being called all sorts of things in defence of one person,&rdquo; he said.Malema said the country and its Constitution were more important than individuals.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/malema-defends-anc-veterans-20161108
