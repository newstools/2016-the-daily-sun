COSATU wants deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa to be the next ANC president.The Central Executive Committee meeting, held from Monday to Wednesday, took a resolution to support and lobby for Ramaphosa.&ldquo;We are not a voting structure of the ANC but we represent workers who are members and supporters of the ANC,&rdquo; said the federation&rsquo;s general secretary, Bheki Ntshalintshali, at a media briefing at Cosatu House in Braamfontein, Joburg yesterday.&ldquo;We also support the proposal that the ANC should explore the possibility of avoiding slates and contestations at the next conference.&rdquo; He added that the committee had reflected on who should lead the ANC out of its current political gridlock into the future.Ntshalintshali said: &ldquo;We engaged in this issue driven by our desire to see the ANC united and ready to lead the second radical phase of our transition.&rdquo;He said they found it troubling that the ANC continued to be preoccupied with internal challenges and continued to be caught in relentless infighting.&ldquo;The meeting also supported the call for a judicial inquiry to look into the alleged corruptive relationship between President Jacob Zuma, some cabinet ministers and the Gupta family.&rdquo; Ntshalintshali said the committee had submitted a vote of no confidence in the Minister of Mineral Resources, Mosebenzi Zwane. &ldquo;The minister was weak and was also a polarising figure who has failed to deal with issues of his sector,&rdquo; he said.Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini said they understood they were not a branch of the ANC but what happens in the ANC affected them.
