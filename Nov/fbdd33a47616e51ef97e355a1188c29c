THE Home Affairs Department and Stats SA have partnered to digitise civil records to improve service delivery. Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba launched the project in Tshwane on thursday. He said it was important to move from keeping records on paper to more modern and secure methods. &ldquo;It will ensure records are easily found to process applications for birth certificates and other important documents.&ldquo;People will now not be forced to visit the department as they can also make their applications online to avoid long queues,&rdquo; said Gigaba, adding that the department had 286 million records, 90% of which were on paper. Statistician-General Pali Lehohla said: &ldquo;The process of digitisation will ensure no one is left behind. &ldquo;These records date back as far as 1800 and we cannot risk them being lost.&rdquo;
