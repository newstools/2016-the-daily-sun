WHEN twins are born, it is taken as a sign of good luck for the blessed mum and dad.So when a set of twins are delivered by twins, then the luck should be doubly good!This is what happened in Alabama, Klerksdorp in North West on Sunday when twin paramedic brothers Dion and Dean Witkoei delivered twin girls!Both families said what happened was a sign of much greater things to happen in their future.Dion and Dean (28) told Daily Sun they were off duty and relaxing after their Saturday night shift when a man came knocking at their door.&ldquo;It was at about 8am when we heard someone knocking frantically. We found a man who lives on the same street as us. He asked us to rush to his place,&rdquo; said Dean.&ldquo;They ran to the man&rsquo;s house where they found his heavily pregnant wife ready to deliver.&ldquo;It was too late to get her to hospital and we helped her deliver the twins with ease. &ldquo;Afterwards we called an ambulance and the lovely newborn girls were transported to Klerksdorp Hospital where they were assessed and admitted.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very proud of ourselves. This is what makes us love our jobs even more. It&rsquo;s a miracle and doesn&rsquo;t happen often. We feel blessed,&rdquo; said Dion.The twin girls are Angelika and &shy;Vanessa Jankies.Their mother, Yolandi Jankies, said she was very grateful.&ldquo;I am at a loss for words to thank the two. They must continue to do more for others.&ldquo;My babies are really blessed as well.&rdquo; the mum said.
