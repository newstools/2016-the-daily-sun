THE church building might only resemble a garage, but the church members know it as the holy ground.That&rsquo;s why they always remove their shoes before entering the church on Sundays.But this Sunday they ended up going home barefoot &ndash; thugs stole their shoes when they were praying!Members of the Christ Apostolic Church Bethesta in Zion had gathered at Nongeni in Duduza, Ekurhuleni.Five pairs of shoes went missing, including those of the priest&rsquo;s son, Bongani Tshabalala (31).&ldquo;It was my pair of white Vans takkies that I loved a lot. Now some people have helped themselves to them. &ldquo;They are evil. How can they do such a thing to praying people? Bad luck will follow them because of their sins,&rdquo; said Bongani.Another member who lost her sandals said she bought the pair particularly to wear to church.&ldquo;My pair of R300 sandals matched my uniform, but now they&rsquo;re gone.&rdquo;Cases of theft were opened at the Duduza cop shop.
