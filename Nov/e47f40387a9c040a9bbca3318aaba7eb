Mamelodi Sundowns have honoured the widow and daughter of the late Gift Leremi after inviting the pair to attend the club's CAF Champions League trophy parade in Tshwane.The Brazilians paraded the trophy this week after securing an historic first win in Africa's most prestigious club competition against Zamalek.Leremi, an attacking midfielder with goals in his locker, was seemingly on his way to becoming a club great before he passed away in a car accident in 2007 at the age of 22.Tragically, the Soweto-born star died after he had returned from a trip into Africa with Downs for a CAF Confederations Cup tie against Astres FC of Cameroon.&nbsp;As such, Sundowns took the step to honour his widow, Mamello, as well as the deceased player's daughter, Kelebogile.Mamello Leremi said of the occasion to the&nbsp;The New Age: "Now my daughter can see her Dad's legacy and what he meant to the country. She can see traces of what her Dad lived for. He has to be proud wherever he is."
