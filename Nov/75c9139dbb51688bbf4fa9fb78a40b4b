FIKILE Monana used to live happily in her three-roomed mkhukhu with her children. But because her ex-boyfriend owes a mashonisa R200, she is now homeless! The 32-year-old from Maphupheni in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni said she was devastated by the loss of her shack, for which she paid R2 800. &ldquo;I knew my ex-boyfriend owed interest to a mashonisa but I never expected my home to be taken away.&rdquo; Fikile said the mashonisa took her brother&rsquo;s mkhukhu last year because he owned him money. She said she was shocked when she returned home from work last Tuesday to find two of the shack&rsquo;s rooms missing. &ldquo;There was no door and two of my three rooms were gone. &ldquo;I had to peep inside through a small hole in the wall to check that my belongings were in the remaining room.&rdquo; Fikile said she and her two children have since moved in with her parents because they struggled to move around the single room.&ldquo;My shack cost me a lot of money and now I have lost it. &ldquo;I tried to go to the police station but I didn&rsquo;t get any help. &ldquo;I want to pay the man the R200 my ex-boyfriend owes him so I can get my shack back.&rdquo; The SunTeam spoke to Fikile&rsquo;s ex-boyfriend, Stembiso Hlatshwayo, who confirmed he owed the mashonisa money. &ldquo;I paid him back the R200 but then he demanded more.&rdquo; He promised to pay the mashonisa every cent he wanted so Fikile could get her house back. &ldquo;I will give him the money he wants when I get paid.&rdquo;
