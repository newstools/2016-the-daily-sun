THE Mabuza siblings fought to keep their parents&rsquo; house when relatives took it from them, but they failed. Now they are asking for help from the ancestors to punish those who stole from them. On Friday, they went to their mum&rsquo;s grave at Vlakfontein Cemetery near KwaThema, Ekurhuleni, to ask her to help them get revenge. Bongani Mabuza (29) said it was heartbreaking that they were homeless even though their parents built them a home. &ldquo;When we were young. Our father died and the company he was working for paid out his pension.&ldquo;Our relatives took that money by claiming he had no kids. Our mum, who died in 2007, battled to get the money back without any luck,&rdquo; he claimed. His sister, Bonisile, added: &ldquo;We are at her grave to ask her to continue this fight for us. We will not rest until we get our money and our house. &ldquo;Because we were young when our parents died, documents belonging to our father were taken by our gogo and she&rsquo;s refusing to give them to us.&rdquo; Bonisile said they tried to open a case of theft against their gogo but the cops couldn&rsquo;t help them because they didn&rsquo;t have any proof. &ldquo;Our relatives are ruthless people. They didn&rsquo;t want us but they wanted our parents&rsquo; belongings,&rdquo; she said. The SunTeam spoke to gogo Priscilla Zulu, who the siblings claimed was the one who had control over their money. She said the siblings must grow up. &ldquo;Those people are too old to be crying over their father&rsquo;s money so many years after he died.&ldquo;If they think they will get something from this house, they must think again. They must start sending out their CVs and stop crying over inheritances,&rdquo; said Priscilla.
