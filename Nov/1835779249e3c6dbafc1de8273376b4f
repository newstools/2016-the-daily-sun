IT IS an age old tradition for mourners to roll up their sleeves and fill the graves of their dead loved ones. But Pitso Maleka from White City in Soweto (39) said he wants mourners to stay clean at funerals. His company, PM Grave Closure, fills graves and makes sure the final resting places of the dead are treated with respect. He said he got the idea in 2002 when he went to a funeral and saw how long it took to fill the grave. &ldquo;People spend money on catering, cars and expensive coffins. But filling the grave is the most striking part of a funeral. It completes the ceremony.&rdquo; Maleka said he strives to exceed the expectations of his customers because he wants to build relationships based on honesty and respect. He has partnered with undertakers in Soweto.&nbsp; He also offers his services to customers around Gauteng and Durban. &ldquo;When people ask about the packages offered by a burial society, they forget that opening and closing the grave is not included as a service,&rdquo; he said. Maleka has 900 employees.&nbsp; He said his business is unique and he does not have any competitors. &ldquo;My company also moves graves, exhumes corpses and maintains graves,&rdquo; he said. The company has worked at the funerals of celebrities such as Simba Mhere, Eddie Zondi, Flabba, Lebo Mathosa, Vuyo Mokoena, Vuyo Mbuli and Zombo.&nbsp; They recently buried legendary radio presenter Segale Mogotsi on Friday.
