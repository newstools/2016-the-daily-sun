MAMELODI&nbsp;Sundowns&nbsp;could play today&rsquo;s Absa Premiership match against&nbsp;Kaizer&nbsp;Chiefs at Loftus Stadium without their key players.Coach&nbsp;Pitso&nbsp;Mosimane&nbsp;was left worried on Thursday when most of his star players failed to continue with their normal training session due to injury.Sundowns first goalkeeper Dennis&nbsp;Onyango,&nbsp;Siyanda&nbsp;Zwane, Anthony&nbsp;Laffor, Khama&nbsp;Billiat,&nbsp;Anele&nbsp;Ngcongca&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hlompho&nbsp;Kekana are all doubtful for the much anticipated league match.&nbsp;Tebogo Langerman will miss the clash as he sustained hamstring injury while at Bafana Bafana. &nbsp;Billiat&nbsp;was seen&nbsp;limping when he got out of the training grounds, complaining about the hamstring injury.The Brazilians&nbsp;are playing catch-up in the league due to their successful campaign in the Caf Champions League and they will be looking to win their matches to claim a top spot on the tables.The other player, who missed the training session, was Captain&nbsp;Hlompho&nbsp;Kekana.&nbsp;Mosimane&nbsp;said most of his players were complaining about fatigue and injuries.&nbsp;He said: &ldquo;You must see the line-up on Saturday (today) most of the players will be seating on the bench.&nbsp;&ldquo;You saw it yourself, Anthony was saying to me he is a bit tired and Khama didn&rsquo;t finish the training session.&rdquo;Added&nbsp;Mosimane: &ldquo;Another player is&nbsp;Tiyani&nbsp;Mabunda, who played two games while at&nbsp;Bafana&nbsp;Bafana, and it is the story that I always spoke about.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t risk playing&nbsp;Mabunda&nbsp;because he could sustain an injury and I could miss him for the Club World Cup and I can&rsquo;t afford that.&rdquo;However, the African Champions will welcome back their dangerous striker Leonardo Castro back from injury.&nbsp;Castro sustained an ankle injury back in August and&nbsp;was forced&nbsp;to watch his side lift the Caf Champions League title on the stands.
