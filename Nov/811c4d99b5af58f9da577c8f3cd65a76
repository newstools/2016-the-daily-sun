THE national minimum wage announced by deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa has been rejected by a number of different stakeholders. Some have said the proposed R3 500 entry salary is laughable and favours business at the expense of workers while others have said it will lead to job losses. Ramaphosa said the figure he announced had been recommended by a panel of advisors but consultation was still taking place and it could change. The EFF said the proposed figure would not address inequality and would instead reinforce it. The party said unions had proposed R4 500 two years ago but since inflation had increased, R5 000 was a more reasonable number. &ldquo;Anything below R4 500 will not make a difference to the lives of workers.&rdquo; The party also rejected the idea of not applying the minimum wage to farmworkers whose minium wage is R3 150, and also to domestic workers whose minimum wage was set at R2 625 a month. On the other hand, the Institute for Race Relations argued that the proposed figure would do little to improve the lives of existing workers and would make it harder for the unemployed to find jobs. The institute said it would also be an obstacle to the creation of small businesses. &ldquo;The drafters of the proposal have simply been playing politics with no regard for the interests of the economy or the unemployed.&rdquo; Many unions have, however, warmed to the proposal, saying although the figure is too low it&rsquo;s a starting point.The issue is expected to be discussed at Cosatu&rsquo;s central executive committee meeting which started yesterday.
