JACOB Mkhize was fast asleep when he heard his madala&rsquo;s voice calling him. The voice told him to wake up and run. Just moments after he obeyed the order and ran out of his shack, a tree fell on it and destroyed it! The 61-year-old from Holomisa squatter camp in Soweto said when his madala, Umpika Zulu, was alive, he was a strict man who demanded obedience. He said this was why he listened to the voice when it woke him up at 2am yesterday morning. Jacob told the SunTeam he felt lucky to have a madala who continued caring for him even after his death. He said if he had not been warned, the tree would have killed him. &ldquo;He used to look after me when he was alive and he&rsquo;s still looking after me from the grave. I am a lucky grandson,&rdquo; said Jacob. He said he was happy to know his madala had not forgotten about him even though he died 30 years ago. &ldquo;That tree destroyed my shack. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have survived if I was still inside when it fell.&rdquo;Jacob said all he could do was watch in horror as the tree destroyed his home. &ldquo;I was outside trying to pee in a nearby toilet when I saw it going down and landing on my shack,&rdquo; he said. Community leader Phillip Mnomiya said he hoped the municipality would do something about the large trees in the kasi. &ldquo;We are lucky no lives have been lost, but we fear something terrible will happen one day.&rdquo;
