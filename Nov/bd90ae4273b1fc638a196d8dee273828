COMMUTERS spent their journey in the presence of preacher Thanduxolo Mtakwende (43) on Tuesday morning.While the train travelled from Uitenhage to Port Elizabeth the passengers spent their time reading Bible verses on their tablets while preacher Thanduxolo read from Mark 4:35 and spoke about Jesus. He said: &ldquo;Jesus calmed the storms while on the boat. &ldquo;How I wish I was on that boat. They panicked while they had Jesus. How do you panic when you have God in you?&rdquo; Thanduxolo ended by saying nothing is impossible with God.&ldquo;For you to need God, you need storms. We are now facing December, let us cross over triumphantly. You will never miss your destiny.&rdquo;
