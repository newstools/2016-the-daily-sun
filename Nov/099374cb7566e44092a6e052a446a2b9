MANY kasi residents have to deal with the unbearable smell of kak due to overflowing drains.And in almost all cases, it takes municipal workers weeks to fix the problem.But these villagers in Limpopo have been forced to live with kak in their yards for more than five months.Their street in Mhinga Village, Malamulele has been turned into a river of sewage that floods their yards due to a blocked drain.Residents said the smell has affected their health. Pearly Makondo (39) said: &ldquo;The smell of kak has made our lives a living hell. We can&rsquo;t even enjoy our food because of the bad smell in our yards. Sometimes the smell is so unbearable that I spend the whole day in a neighbouring village.&rdquo; He said they reported the matter to the municipality several times, but nothing has been done about it.Another resident, madala Giyani Hlungwani, said kak is ruining their lives and they want the municipality to repair the blocked drain. Moses Shivambu, a spokesman for Thulamela Municipality, said they were aware of the sewage blockages in Mhinga Village. &ldquo;We met traditional leaders last week, and we&rsquo;re working around the clock to make sure that the matter is resolved,&rdquo; he said.
