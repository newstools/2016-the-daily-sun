ON Monday when they returned from work, they found their house reduced to a pile of bricks.Portia Chiburi (28) from Alexandra, Joburg said her husband called her to say their house had been washed away.&ldquo;I found everything scattered, soaked in water. My house was just a heap of broken belongings and rubble.&rdquo; Her nine-year-old daughter had just escaped from the falling house. &ldquo;My neighbours told me they shouted to my daughter to run out of the house.&ldquo;If it was not for them, she would have been buried in the rubble.&rdquo; Over 30 other houses around Alex were damaged by the wind and rain.Gogo Kubani Chauke (58) said a wall fell on top of her shack. &ldquo;My seven-month-old granddaughter&rsquo;s mum had to crawl under iron sheets to fetch her.&rdquo;Robert Chauke (53) said his Bible, certificates and ID were all soaked. Residents said what caused so much chaos is the drainage system that doesn&rsquo;t work in many parts of Alex.&ldquo;When it rains the water settles, with no drains or blocked drains that don&rsquo;t take water,&rdquo; said Reason Makhubela (30). He added that government must fix the drainage before more damage is done after a creche wall collapsed.
