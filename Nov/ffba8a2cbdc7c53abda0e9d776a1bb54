HER mouth reveals what Diketso believes is a family curse.Diketso Silinda (32), from Casteel near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, said her family members have always had toothless smiles.She thought the curse would skip a generation and leave her alone, but she couldn&rsquo;t have been more wrong.Without feeling any pain, Diketso has already lost many teeth &ndash; some have simply broken in half!She said since the trouble started in 1994 she has stopped smiling broadly or laughing loudly. Her mother took her to Tintswalo Hospital in Acornhoek, where a dentist covered the cracks and discharged her.&ldquo;But in January this year my problems started again,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Eight of my teeth fell out, one after the other. Two more fell out last week. I didn&rsquo;t even feel any pain. Now I am too ashamed to even smile with my friends or my lover.&rdquo;Diketso said her mother&rsquo;s family started losing their teeth at the age of 30. &ldquo;I believe this is a curse, but I grew up in a Christian family and we don&rsquo;t consult sangomas.&rdquo;Diketso&rsquo;s mum Sheila (54) said everyone in the family, especially the elders, has the same problem. &ldquo;We thought it could be because we ate too much sugar,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;Most of the elders in the family owned shops, so we got sweets for free,&rdquo; Sheila said.But they have realised the problem is more than that because even the children are losing their teeth. &ldquo;Dentists say we have a tooth decay problem &ndash; we all have to wear false teeth,&rdquo; said Sheila.Dr Ben Makukule advised the family to consult the hospital&rsquo;s dentists for help.Traditional healer Annuary Ndlovu said the family may be cursed. Despite their Christian beliefs, they should consult a sangoma.
