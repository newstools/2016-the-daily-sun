MARITZBURG United have drawn up a shortlist of coaches to replace Ernst Middendorp, who quit yesterday.Middendorp, who resigned yesterday on the back of the club&rsquo;s 3-2 away Absa Premiership loss to Cape Town City this week, has coached almost every club in the PSL and was in his third spell with the Team of Choice. Maritzburg chairman Farook Kadodia told SunSport they were not in a big rush to hire a new coach. Assistant coach Fadlu Davids is in charge for now. &ldquo;Middendorp&rsquo;s resignation came as a shock and surprise to us,&rdquo; claimed Kadodia yesterday.Former Ajax Cape Town coach Roger de Sa could be an option but Kadodia denied any link: &ldquo;I have not spoken to De Sa or any other coach at this stage.&rdquo;Middendorp has proved to be one of the most difficult coaches to deal with in the Premier Soccer League (PSL). His rants at the media and referees, often on live television and at press conferences, had forced the bad-tempered German-born coach to issue an apology to the PSL for his outbursts last month.However, Kadodia said despite all the coach&rsquo;s tantrums, he tried to persuade Middendorp to stay: &ldquo;It was a painful decision to allow him to go. But he was adamant that his resignation was in the best interest of the club.&rdquo;Middendorp has never been far from controversy and dumped Free State Stars 11 months ago to rejoin the Team of Choice for the third time.He took on the job when they were rock-bottom in the league and managed to save them by beating Jomo Cosmos 3-1 in their last match of the season. In a statement Middendorp said: &ldquo;I indicated after the Cape Town assignment that I would resign. The chairman tried very hard to persuade me to stay and complete what I had started, but I felt very strongly that it was in the interest of the club that I step down.&rdquo;
