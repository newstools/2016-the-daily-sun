THE Abathembu nation has been rocked by the sudden death of rival faction spokesman,Chief Daludumo Mtirara. On Friday morning the news of his death ,an alleged suicide,emerged as preparations to inaugurate Prince Azenathi Dalindyebo as acting king.Thembu chief Mfundo Bhovulengwe Mtirara confirmed to the SunTeam that Daludumo was found dead in his home in Pretoria."Yes the news are true unfortunately. Police are at the scene and it seems he died of a gunshot wound and it is a possible suicide."Daludumo was a member of the SA National Defence Force.Defence Force spokesman Brigadier General Xolani Mbanga confirmed Daludumo's death but said details were still very sketchy and they would not release much information at this stage."Yes he was a Brigadier General in the SA National Defence at the time of his death and was based in Pretoria. We are not in a position to comment further at this stage."Mtirara was a vocal spokesman of the faction calling themselves the Abathembu Royal Family which supported jailed king Buleyekhaya Dalindyebo's&nbsp; brother Mankunku to&nbsp; become acting king.On Thursday their ambitions were dealt a blow in the Grahamstown High Court when Mankunku withdrew his application to try and stop today's inauguration of his nephew Azenathi.Daludumo was unavailable for comment since the court outcome.A statement released Abathembu Royal Family just recently said that the death should not be linked with the outcome of the court application.
