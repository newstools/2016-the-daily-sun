ISHMAEL Letsoho said driving in and out of his yard is a daily struggle. The 43-year-old from Motloung Section in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, believes he has a right to go in and out of his home freely.But the problem is that there is a big Apollo street light that is blocking his gateway and entrance.Ishmael now parks his precious car outside the gate when he is at home during the day. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a prisoner in my own yard and nobody cares,&rdquo; said Ishmael.According to Ishmael, he has complained numerous times to the City of Ekurhuleni about the matter without much help. &ldquo;I have nearly been hit by passing cars while trying to manoeuvre my way in and out of the yard on numerous occasions,&rdquo; he said.Ishmael added that he&rsquo;s not the only one who is experiencing the problem in the area.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick and tired of this unnecessary stress. &ldquo;Every time I have to get into my yard it&rsquo;s a mission to park my car. &ldquo;The pole is not in the correct spot. &ldquo;I want them to come and move it so that I can have clear and easy access to my yard. &ldquo;Visitors are also forced to park their cars outside where it isn&rsquo;t safe,&rdquo; he said.Ekurhuleni Metro spokesman Themba Gadebe said the complainant should apply for the repositioning of the pole.&ldquo;The pole was erected a number of years before the driveway was constructed. &ldquo;The consumer is advised to visit the nearest energy department&rsquo;s customer care area and make an application for the relocation of the streetlight pole,&rdquo; said Gadebe.
