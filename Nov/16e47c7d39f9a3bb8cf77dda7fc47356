LEADER of the #FeesMustFall movement Mcebo Dlamini is a free man. Mcebo was granted R2 000 bail in the High Court Sitting in Palm Ridge today"This is a sign that justice will always prevail," Dlamini said after the court set aside the Johannesburg Magistrate&rsquo;s Court&rsquo;s October 19 ruling denying him bail.Judge Ratha Mokgoatlheng set three bail conditions: he is not allowed to make contact with witnesses, he is not allowed to interfere with the police investigation, and he is not allowed to disrupt campus activity. The judge said he was aware that the charges against Dlamini were serious.Dlamini wore a green top and a black and white keffiyeh over his shoulders. His ankles were chained. He greeted fellow student leader Vuyani Pambo and smiled at students who had come to support him.Mokgoatlheng said the magistrate&rsquo;s court ruling that Dlamini would pose a danger to society was wrong."This court will furnish reasons which predicate the setting aside the denial of bail within 14 days," he said.Dlamini is charged with violating a court order, public violence, assault, theft and damage to property. He was arrested on October 16.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/mcebo-dlamini-gets-r2-000-bail-20161109
