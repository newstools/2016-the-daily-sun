A NUMBER of bond houses built by Anglo American for employees have started falling apart. And according to the owners of the houses in Northam extension 6, Limpopo, the construction company that built the homes ripped the mining company off. Residents said the situation was made even more ridiculous by the fact that the mining company had used a construction company that won the Govan Mbeki Award from the provincial government. Residents told Daily Sun they had been complaining about their houses for three years but no one seemed willing to help them. &ldquo;We decided to seek help from the media to expose this matter. It&rsquo;s our only hope,&rdquo; a letter sent to the SunTeam by residents read. Community spokesmen Olebogeng Pilane and Mmapheko Molefe said although workers were paying bonds on the houses, many of them were built from worse materials than RDPs. &ldquo;Everything is a mess. In some of the houses, hot water goes into the toilet when it&rsquo;s flushed. Ceilings are cracking because water is leaking from geysers, and cracks in the walls could make the roofs fall down,&rdquo; said Pilane. According to residents, Anglo American promised to do maintenance on the houses for the first five years and the oldest house was only built four years ago. Mpumi Sithole, the mining company&rsquo;s spokeswoman, said: &ldquo;We are aware of the complaints. Early this month, we organised a meeting with stakeholders, including community representatives. &ldquo;The stakeholders agreed to take part in an audit to ensure all complaints are identified. We will visit all households that have raised complaints.&rdquo;
