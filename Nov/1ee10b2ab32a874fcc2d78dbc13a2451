BOOZERS continued dancing into the early hours of Monday morning while the body of a man who had just been stoned lay 50 metres away! The victim, Sivuyile &ldquo;Buti-buti&rdquo; Coto (32) was apparently followed by thugs and murdered after he left his friends dancing near a petrol station in KwaNobuhle kasi, Uitenhage, in Nelson Mandela Bay. The two thugs who pounced on him apparently wanted his cellphone and money and cruelly pelted him with stones until he was dead. His aunt, Moli Majola (43) said she and her gogo, Neli Toba (87) were woken by a tavern bouncer knocking on their door. &ldquo;He told me what had happened and I rushed to the scene. Butibuti had been hit on the back of the head with a bottle. There were stones lying around and his jaw was broken. The skin on his head had peeled off.&ldquo;Boozers were standing over him and trying to identify him. There was blood on his mouth and ears and his cheeks had been flattened by stones.&rdquo;Moli said Butibuti had left home at about 9pm on Sunday to go drinking. &ldquo;He was a sweet person and our breadwinner. He would sometimes come home drunk but he never caused any damage.&rdquo; Captain Gerda Swart, a police spokeswoman, said: &ldquo;The police are investigating a case of murder after a man&rsquo;s body was found at 1.25am on Poswa Street. He had wounds to his head. No arrests have been made yet and anyone with information should phone the police on 041 978 8600.&rdquo;
