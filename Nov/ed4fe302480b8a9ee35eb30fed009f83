But he told News24 what the driver did was against the law.&ldquo;The department is aware of the video and an internal investigation has been launched for disciplinary purposes,&rdquo; said Mchunu.He added the department will inform the media once the investigation has been finalised. &ldquo;The person being investigated will have to plead and state his case,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
