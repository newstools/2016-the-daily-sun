PAY day is every workers&rsquo; favourite day, as they smile all the way to the bank.But for a Joburg Metro cop at Soweto&rsquo;s Dube Vocational Centre, pay day became hate day as he was apparently not paid.The frustrated cop yesterday went on a rampage, smashing the windscreen of Metro cop cars and spraying water into several licensing offices.An insider who works at the centre told Daily Sun that the man desperately needed his money to go home to the Eastern Cape.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been enquiring about his salary since 27 October. And he was the only one who had not been paid.&rdquo;It is also claimed that this wasn&rsquo;t the first time the man had complained about payment delays.The extent of the damage is still unknown as investigations are underway.Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar of the Joburg Metro police said the officer was arrested yesterday morning for malicious damage to property.He said the officer would undergo psychiatric evaluation. When asked whether the man&rsquo;s anger had been fuelled by payment issues, Minnaar said it would form part of the investigation.
