SOME think it&rsquo;s bad luck, others say it&rsquo;s all good . . . and many think it&rsquo;s just a kitten born with three legs and nothing more.But Similo Ngxale (60) &ndash; who lives in Mdantsane, a kasi outside East London &ndash; said he needs to know what it means. His pet cat gave birth to the three-legged kitten and he said he felt sure it had to mean something, especially as 2016 was a year he hated. But so far everyone Similo has asked had a different opinion on the matter, leaving him confused.&ldquo;I decided to come to the People&rsquo;s Paper and ask SunReaders what they think it means,&rdquo; said Similo.He said he was surprised when one of the litter of three his cat gave birth to in early November had only one front leg. The other kittens in the litter were normal.&ldquo;Some people say I should kill this cat and her babies and throw it away because they will bring bad luck. &ldquo;Others say I should keep the cat because it&rsquo;s a symbol of good luck that&rsquo;s coming,&rdquo; said Similo, a truck driver from Buffalo City Municipality.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard of a cat with three legs in my life. I hope there&rsquo;s someone who can tell me what it all means.&rdquo; Similo said he gave the other two kittens to people who wanted pets, and left the three-legged one with its mum. &ldquo;I noticed that this cat liked the kitten with three legs more than the others.&rdquo;Similo said 2016 had been a bad year to him. As the only breadwinner in the family, he sends R2 000 each month to his family in the village. &ldquo;On top of that I have to pay more than R1 000 for municipal rates. I also have a son who&rsquo;s doing grade 12 and he needs R50 every day for transport and lunch. &ldquo;Now my boss doesn&rsquo;t want to allow me to work overtime so that I can earn extra cash. It seems only other people get to work overtime. That&rsquo;s why I say I hate this year,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Now I get a cat with three legs! What does it mean? SunReaders please tell me.&rdquo;He added that he wouldn&rsquo;t kill the cats because he&rsquo;s an animal lover.
