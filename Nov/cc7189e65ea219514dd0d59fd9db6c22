THE cattle owner knew his animals well, so he immediately noticed when three of them went missing.After a search for the missing cattle was unsuccessful, the Black Mambas, a group dedicated to fighting stock theft, took the lead. On Friday, they found the missing cattle in a man&rsquo;s kraal and when he was confronted by the cops he said he needed them for lobola! The 35-year-old suspect from KwaCeza, in northern KZN allegedly pleaded with cops to allow him to transport the cows to his future in-laws&rsquo; residence in a nearby village. Vincent Mashazi (32), the brother of the owner of the cattle, told Daily Sun the cows disappeared from a grazing field in Vryheid on Wednesday. &ldquo;After we searched and found nothing, we realised the cows could have been stolen as stock theft is very common in the area&rdquo; he said. Vincent, who is also the deputy chairman of the Black Mamba organisation, told Daily Sun he mobilised his organisation to help find the cows.&ldquo;We received a tip-off that a man from KwaCeza had our cattle in his kraal and was about to transport them to another village. &ldquo;We rushed there and hid outside his premises to monitor his moves while we waited for the cops. The cows were tied separately outside his kraal and a livestock delivery truck was there.&ldquo;When cops arrived, he said he had bought the cows on credit from another person. He admitted that he was going to pay lobola. &ldquo;But judging from the cow skins we found in his yard, he is a wealthy, unemployed man,&rdquo; a suspicious Vincent said.KZN police spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane, said three suspects were arrested by the KwaCeza police&rsquo;s stock theft unit.&ldquo;The one who was found in a possession of stolen cows was charged with stock theft. He will appear in the Vryheid Magistrates Court today. The other two suspects are still under investigation.&rdquo;
