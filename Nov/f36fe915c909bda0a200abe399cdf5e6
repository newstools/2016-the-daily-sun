THE Ezimbale Se Sizwe organisation aims to raise girls to love and respect themselves. The cultural group based in Daveyton&rsquo;s Emaphupheni section of Ekurhuleni is teaching them to abstain from sex before marriage. Its mission is to work with parents to prevent teenage pregnancies. Founder Johanah Mthethwa told Daily Sun: &ldquo;There were no sicknesses in the old days when young people knew their boundaries. It&rsquo;s time to bring cultural practices back to save young lives. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re proud to be part of these traditions as we shape future leaders, who will then shape the youth of tomorrow.&rdquo; Johanah said the girls she works with are checked to make sure they are virgins. &ldquo;The girls bond through song and take part in group activities. &ldquo;Every year, they visit KZN to take part in the reed dance and learn pride.&rdquo;
