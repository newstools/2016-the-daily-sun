CORRUPTION Watch officials gathered outside Home Affairs in Marabastad, Tshwane after the release of its report on corruption on Tuesday.The organisation has been investigating corruption and bribery claims against the department for over a year.In its report called &ldquo;Project Lokisa: Asylum at a Price&rdquo;, it recognised that corruption and bribery were violating constitutional rights.David Louis, director for Corruption Watch, said each week more than 120 cases are reported to them about the Marabastad refugee reception office.He said the department has failed to respond to any of the attempts to report complaints received from foreigners. He said three individuals were implicated in corruption at their offices.&ldquo;We have opened criminal cases as a result of investigations into allegations of extortion, threats and bribery by government officials.&rdquo; Marc Gbaffou, African Diaspora Forum chairman, said he was disturbed when people told him they were unable to receive their documents because they didn&rsquo;t have money to bribe.&ldquo;They say South Africa belongs to all who live in it, but why are we treated differently?&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to see people coming to the refugee offices as though it&rsquo;s a market.&rdquo;Mavuso Msimanga, chairman of the organisation, said the department has failed the people.&ldquo;Do what the constitution tells you to do.&ldquo;Stop taking food from refugees who are also trying to make a living.&rdquo;
