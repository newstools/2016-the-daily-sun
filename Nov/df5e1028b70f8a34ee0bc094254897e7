&ldquo;I AM willing to die for my love!&rdquo; These were the words of Thando Rafani after he was stabbed three times in the ribs on Saturday, allegedly by his ex-girlfriend&rsquo;s new lover! The 34-year-old from Zola in Soweto told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I met this woman nine years ago and I knew she was the one I would be spending my life with. We fell madly in love and moved in together. &ldquo;She was unemployed and had a child from a previous relationship but it didn&rsquo;t bother me much. I treated her like a queen and raised the child as my own.&rdquo; However, things started going downhill for Thando when he lost his job. &ldquo;They repossessed my furniture and my landlord kicked me out of my flat. Then my girlfriend told me she was leaving because I couldn&rsquo;t provide for her any more.&rdquo;When Thando spotted his ex-girlfriend, Noma Badela on the street with her new lover he decided to confront her and it almost cost him his life. Her new lover allegedly stabbed him three times and he had to be rushed to hospital. However, Thando said he was still madly in love with Noma. &ldquo;I will do anything to be with her, even if it means I have to be stabbed 100 times.&rdquo;When the SunTeam contacted Noma, she said: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t live in poverty. I can&rsquo;t be with a man who can&rsquo;t provide for my child and me. Yes, I am still in love with him but love can&rsquo;t feed a family. I am willing to give him a second chance if he gets his life together.&rdquo;
