DERICK Mosoana believes if Clive Derby-Lewis&rsquo; body is buried in African soil the continent will be haunted.Mosoana, Sekhukhune Congress leader, said for the country to free from the events of the past, Lewis&rsquo; body must be cremated and not buried. &ldquo;He was found to have lied in his affidavit during the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and as a result his amnesty was not granted.&rdquo; Lewis was sentenced to life imprisonment for masterminding the killing of South African Communist Party leader Chris Hani in 1993. Lewis died last week at the age of 80. He was out on medical parole after being diagnosed with cancer. Mosoana is also calling on South Africans to wear black for at least a day this week to commemorate the life of Chris Hani. &ldquo;We will never forgive Baas Lewis for his demonic acts and thus cannot accept him being buried in African soil.&rdquo;
