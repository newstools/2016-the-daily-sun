MANY unemployed youths in his kasi have given up on life and are using drugs.But Mthandeni Khumalo is using his hands to make a living. The 32-year-old man from Imbali in Pietermaritzburg makes wooden benches. He runs his business in Slangspruit, a township near his kasi. He started the business in 2014.&ldquo;Jobs are scarce, so it&rsquo;s important for people to think of other ways to make a living,&rdquo; said Mthandeni.He said that after he couldn&rsquo;t find work he decided to use his skills to survive. &ldquo;Life was tough after I couldn&rsquo;t find work. I even thought of using drugs because I couldn&rsquo;t provide for my family. &ldquo;But after I spoke to one of my uncles, my eyes were opened,&rdquo; Mthandeni told Daily Sun. &ldquo;He told me that I could use my hands to make a living.&rdquo;He said he thought of wood when his uncle told him about starting his business.&ldquo;I went to the forest, cut down a tree and made a beautiful small bench. I realised that I must stop looking for a job.&ldquo;Today I&rsquo;m proud to be my own boss. I&rsquo;m also able to take care of my four siblings and my daughter (4),&rdquo; said Mthandeni. He said most of his customers are people who own bakkies.&ldquo;They buy the benches to put them at the back of their vehicles and use the benches as passengers&rsquo; seats.&ldquo;Home owners also support me.&rdquo;Mthandeni said young people should stop being lazy and start doing things for themselves. &ldquo;Most of the youths are talented, but they are lazy.&ldquo;They always wait for the government to do things for them,&rdquo; he said.
