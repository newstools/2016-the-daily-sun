IN THIS town, drugs and punanis are sold like vetkoek. Vereeniging in the Vaal is known for its brothels and booming drug trade.In recent weeks, residents have attempted to shut down the illegal businesses on their own. Yesterday, angry residents who are part of an initiative called Citizens on Patrol staged a peaceful protest in front of the Vereeniging Magistrates Court in Leslie Street.The chairman of Citizens on Patrol, Mokete Ketsise, said they are tired of women selling their bodies in front of their kids and families.&ldquo;We are asking the police and the court to help us get rid of crime in our area,&rdquo; said Ketsise. He added some residents made the problem worse by renting out their houses to magoshas and drug dealers.The angry residents also said they are concerned about their safety as they could no longer walk around their own town, especially in the evening, when the illegal businesses sell punanis and drugs openly in the streets. Residents handed over a memorandum to Vereeniging police cluster commander Brigadier Pule Mokoena and a magistrate from the court.Another community leader, Bongani Ntshingila, said: &ldquo;When the magoshas are done they leave used condoms in the streets for kids to discover in the morning and to blow up like balloons.&rdquo;The police and the court were given 14 days to respond to issues raised in the memorandum.
