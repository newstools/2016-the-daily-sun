SUNLANDERS, Christmas is drawing closer! Let&rsquo;s get together and put smiles on the faces of those who are less fortunate than ourselves.Your donations will help neglected, abandoned, abused and disabled children experience love and joy.The Gauteng Department of Social Development has identified five children&rsquo;s homes around the province in need of your help. We can all help make Christmas a special day for the kids at these homes.Daily Sun already has two donors on board, but we still need ordinary people to stretch out a helping hand. The People&rsquo;s Paper is going to prepare a delicious Christmas lunch for the destitute kids.We are appealing to big donors to come forward, but more than anything, we are asking SunReaders to help where they can. Your contribution, large or small, will be accepted with gratitude on behalf of the children who need it most. We are waiting for your suggestions and gifts. Call us on 011 877 6060 and tell us how you can help.You can also bring your gift to our office in Auckland Park, Joburg. We will welcome you and your contribution or ideas with open arms.Let&rsquo;s use Christmas as an opportunity to show these kids they still have something to smile about despite their circumstances.
