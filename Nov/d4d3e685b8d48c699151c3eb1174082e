THE thugs knew Thabo was not at home &ndash; so they thought they could take their time while they cleaned out his house.Little did they know that Thabo&rsquo;s neighbour was taking pictures of them and their bakkie.Thabo Mabasa (40) from Extension 28, Protea Glen, Soweto said he had lost about R90 000 worth of his belongings on Wednesday.He said he was at work when his neighbour called to inform him that his house had been robbed. &ldquo;Everything was gone including the wedding presents my wife&rsquo;s friends and family gave my wife,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I took the photos of the thugs to Protea Glen Police Station, where I also opened a case.&rdquo;However, he said cops had not taken the photos, which show the registration plate of the thugs&rsquo; bakkie. &ldquo;I have to chase after the cops to do their work. I am tired of forcing police officers to do their job,&rdquo; he said.Thabo said his neighbour called the cops, but the suspects were already gone when they arrived.Last month Daily Sun shared Elizabeth Mamasila&rsquo;s story.
