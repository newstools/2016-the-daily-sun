GAUTENG&rsquo;s Premier David Makhura has urged health workers to be more friendly and helpful when interacting with patients at health care centres. This follows the results of the Gauteng City-Region Observatory (GCRO) quality of life survey fourth report, done last year, which revealed the bad attitude of health workers towards patients was a major concern. The bad attitude was one of the major concerns brought forward by patients at different health care centres.Speaking at this year&rsquo;s Khanyisa Services Excellence Awards at Gallagher Convention Centre on Friday night, Makhura challenged the health workers to vow to change their attitude.&ldquo;Some of the concerns of our citizens pertaining to the public health care system are the long queues, long waiting periods for operations and the bad attitude of health workers. As we gather here tonight we must make a vow to reduce the waiting period and change the attitude of health workers in our institutions,&rdquo; Makhura said.The premier urged the workers to pull up their socks and ensure that they provided quality health care. &ldquo;Currently the level of satisfaction with health care services is only 69%. My target is that we must reach at least 80% by 2019.&rdquo; He said the Gauteng provincial government alone managed one of the biggest health care systems in sub-Saharan Africa.It employs 6 700 staff members scattered among 36 hospitals, 36 community health centres and 375 clinics around the province and they attend to 7.1 million patients a year on a budget of R34 billion.&ldquo;Tonight&rsquo;s awards are there to acknowledge those health workers who go beyond the line of duty in assisting patients.&rdquo;
