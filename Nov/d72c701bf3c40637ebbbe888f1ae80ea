A REGIONAL secretary-general of the ANC is in big trouble. The DA claims Bheki Ngobese continued to receive a salary after resigning from his job at the Sedibeng Municipality in the Vaal! The Segibeng region secretary general reportedly owes the municipality more than R900 000. The DA has written to ANC Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe and Gauteng Human Settlements MEC Paul Mashatile to demand an explanation for why Ngobese received salaries from both the party and the municipality. Ngobese allegedly continued receiving a salary from the municipality following his resignation in 2014 after he was elected regional secretary-general. The salary for the ANC job is rumoured to be similar to that of a mayor or MMC. The DA claimed Ngobese had been paid more than R900 000 by the municipality since 2014, despite no longer being an employee. In a statement issued by the DA, the party said Ngobese&rsquo;s second salary was illegal and it was clear that the ANC in Gauteng was abusing state resources to enrich the party faithful. The party said the only way to resolve the issue was to force Ngobese to pay back the R900 000. The DA said it would continue pursuing the matter on municipal and provincial level and would not hesitate to lay criminal charges if Ngobese refused to pay back the money. ANC Sedibeng region spokesman Themba Ndaba said they would investigate the matter.&ldquo;While the ANC is concerned about the issue, it must be noted the matter is between the employer, the municipality and the employee. &ldquo;The ANC will investigate the matter.&rdquo;
