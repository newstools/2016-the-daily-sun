WHEN heavy rain destroyed their house two weeks ago, the Ndabas were left with no option but to ask for shelter from neighbours. The desperate family from Ndindani Village in Nquthu, northern KZN cried tears of joy on Saturday when KZN co-operative governance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube visited them. The MEC brought a team of disaster management officials to inspect the extent of the damage caused to the family home by heavy rain, and provided food parcels and temporary shelter.The family of six rely solely on government social grants. Gogo Thandekile (78) said: &ldquo;We had to sleep at the house of one of our neighbours after our home collapsed due to the heavy rain and terrible thunderstorm. &ldquo;We were lucky because no one was hurt.&rdquo; The family was one of 220 affected by a severe storm that hit the Umzinyathi district last month. &ldquo;The department&rsquo;s reports indicate that 11 people were injured. &ldquo;Five people were struck by lightning, and one person was killed in Entabeni Village,&rdquo; said the MEC. She encouraged residents to work with municipalities to ensure their houses met proper building standards. Earlier in the day, Dube-Ncube attended a prayer session ahead of Newcastle&rsquo;s by-election on Wednesday. She called on all parties participating to be tolerant of each other. The by-election was called to replace three candidate councillors who were murdered before the local government election. Their names could not be removed from the ballots in time for the election.
