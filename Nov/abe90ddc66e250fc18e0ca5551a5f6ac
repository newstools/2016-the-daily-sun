I was a forward. &ldquo;Rugby was more popular than soccer in our location. &ldquo;On Saturdays residents would go to the sport fields to watch rugby. &ldquo;Today people seem to enjoy soccer more than rugby.&rdquo;Mzawndile said nurses at the local clinic advised him to exercise regularly to stay healthy. &ldquo;Eventually, I saw this gym and I didn&rsquo;t hesitate to go and train,&rdquo; he told the People&rsquo;s Paper.&ldquo;I like training and staying fit.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sit at home or in one place all the time.&rdquo;He said his wife, Nobuntu (70), is very supportive.&ldquo;When I tell her I&rsquo;m going to exercise in the morning she supports me. She even tells visitors where to find me.&rdquo;Madala Mzwandile said most of the time kids play at the gym.&ldquo;But I use the machines to train my arms, legs, waste and chest,&rdquo; said the father of five.&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stop exercising because it also keeps my mind fresh.&rdquo;The madala said kids should take exercise seriously as it will help them to do well at school.
