JOSEPH MOLANGOANE will know his fate on Tuesday.This when the Premier Soccer League&rsquo;s Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) decides whether he will remain with Chippa United or join Kaizer Chiefs.The skillful midfielder took the Port Elizabeth side to the DRC in a bid to get his clearance.He claimed his contract with the Chilli Boys expired at the end of last season, while management insisted he renewed it for a further two years.Amakhosi showed interest in the player&rsquo;s signature, but they couldn&rsquo;t seal the deal due to the issue.The 28-year-old is currently training with Africa Sport Youth Academy in Joburg and hopes to win the case.Chippa boss, Siviwe Mpengesi, told SunSport he has not given up hope of seeing the player donning their jersey again.Said Mpengesi: &ldquo;I still want him to come back. I like the boy and he&rsquo;s still part of our plans. We&rsquo;re hoping to settle this matter and also clear allegations that we forged his signature. Joseph is getting old and this thing is not helping him.&rdquo;Mpengesi revealed the player has showed interest in returning but bad advice seems to be his stumbling block.&ldquo;I talk to him from time to time.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s keen to come back but he&rsquo;s getting bad advice,&rdquo; said Mpengesi.
