&ldquo;STAY away from my home and my wife. If you don&rsquo;t, bad things will happen to you.&rdquo;These are the furious words of Tiger Mboshane (54) of Tembisa, Ekurhuleni. He claims his wife of 10 years, Zodwa Mkhabela (47), is cheating on him with a man who was once his close friend. Zodwa has now left him for Sabelo Nkuna and has filed for divorce.Tiger said he met Zodwa in 1998 and they got married in 2003. They bought a house in Mbombela, Mpumalanga and he bought her a BMW X5.Tiger claimed his wife started going out and coming back late at night. &ldquo;And one night a friend phoned me and said she had booked into a hotel with Sabelo. &ldquo;Things got so bad, Sabelo started phoning her at home. When I went out, neighbours would tell me there was a man in my house.&rdquo;&ldquo;She has filed for divorce, she wants half of my belongings and I have been forced out of my house.&rdquo;He claimed Sabelo goes to hospital often and his 4-5 doesn&rsquo;t work.&ldquo;He tells people he has diabetes but I&rsquo;ve consulted a sangoma. Things will only get worse for him,&rdquo; said Tiger. Zodwa told Daily Sun Tiger failed as a husband. &ldquo;I have moved on with Sabelo and we will get married when the divorce is finalised,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Sabelo&rsquo;s 4-5 works fine. Would I still be with him if it didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;Sabelo claimed Tiger sent thugs to his house to kill him. &ldquo;He calls, making threats. He should talk to his wife if he has a problem with me visiting her.&rdquo;
