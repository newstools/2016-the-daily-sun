FIRST it was months of drought and water restrictions.Then came days of thunderous rain as roads turned to rivers. And then to add to residents of Ennerdale&rsquo;s suffering, a tornado roared through!Many people were left stranded when roofs were blown away, leaving their furniture and valuables to be damaged on Monday evening.Residents from the kasi in the south of Joburg told Daily Sun they were shocked by the natural disaster.Elton Baumgart said he saw the hailstorm approaching and went into his house to switch off his stove.&ldquo;I was chilling with a friend when I told him I needed to switch off the stove,&rdquo; said Elton.&ldquo;I hurried into the house and moments later the roof was ripped off! I rushed to get my seven-day-old child and her sisters aged seven and 17 into the kitchen for safety.&rdquo; Robert Mulaudzi, Joburg Emergency Management Services spokesman, said.&ldquo;It was really hectic,&rdquo; Mulaudzi, who witnessed the tornado twisting its way through the kasi at about 7pm.&ldquo;It was a very strong wind, very volatile. Things were sent flying around in a circle.&ldquo;One person was hit by a piece of zinc and another was injured when a wall collapsed.&rdquo; Mulaudzi added that emergency services have been bracing themselves for yet another potential weather disaster after last week&rsquo;s catastrophic flash floods left six people dead and others homeless.&ldquo;A child from Alexandra, north of Joburg, is still missing,&rdquo; he added.The city&rsquo;s utility services were on site yesterday morning for emergency repairs, with City Parks workers cutting down damaged trees and removing branches, while Joburg Water and City Power workers checked and repaired water and power connections.
