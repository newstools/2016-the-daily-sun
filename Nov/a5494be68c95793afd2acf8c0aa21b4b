EVER since she lost both her legs, Beauty Qamata has spent most of her time alone in her shack. The 72-year-old gogo from Bacawa squatter camp, near Mdantsane in East London, told Daily Sun her first leg was amputated in 2012 and the other two years later. The gogo said she was alone most of the time as her grandson, who lives with her, went to school during the day and played with his friends outside over weekends. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always scared I&rsquo;ll die in a shack fire. I can&rsquo;t move around the shack and I&rsquo;m always in bed.&ldquo;I have a little table near my bed which I use to cook but I have to be careful that my linen doesn&rsquo;t catch fire.&rdquo;Gogo Beauty said she used to pay someone to help look after her but she had to let her helper go because it was costing too much money. Her only source of income is her disability grant.Most of her money is spent on adult nappies as she can&rsquo;t go to the toilet on her own. Gogo Beauty said she had been living in her shack since 1994. &ldquo;I have applied for an RDP house countless times but while other people enjoy democracy, I live in a shack. I always vote when there&rsquo;s an election but it means nothing.&rdquo; &ldquo;They take us to the voting stations during elections. My councillors know about my situation and but do nothing to help.&rdquo; Eastern Cape Human Settlements Department spokesman Lwandile Sicwetsha said: &ldquo;Please give us her details so we can arrange for officials to visit her and assess her situation.&rdquo;
