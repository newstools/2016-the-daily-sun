FORMER public protector Thuli Madonsela has warned her successor Busisiwe Mkhwebane not to allow herself to be the president&rsquo;s protector. Her statement follows revelations that she is the subject of an investigation by that office.She has been accused of unlawfully leaking an audio recording of her interview with President Jacob Zuma as part of her State of Capture probe to television broadcaster eNCA. Zuma and the ANC have called for Mkhwebane to investigate. On Friday, Zuma told Madonsela to back off because her term has expired. An unfazed Madonsela told City Press: &ldquo;I must say the presidency should be careful about what it gets the new public protector to do. &ldquo;She mustn&rsquo;t be put in a position where she is seen as the president&rsquo;s protector. I think her job is to protect people. The presidency, and particularly the president, should not make it appear as if she is there to protect him.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any law against what I did. But I will establish that from the new public protector. I did not want to issue a media statement where I say somebody is lying. The idea was: here is the transcript, have the audio, let the people decide.&rdquo; Kgalalelo Masibi, the public protector&rsquo;s spokeswoman, said Mkhwebane issued a directive that no further public comments should be made on the matter.
