A criminal charge has been laid against former public protector Thuli Madonsela &ndash; by the new head of the office Busisiwe Mkhwebane, after receiving &ldquo;a complaint from the president&rdquo;. According to a&nbsp;Sunday Times&nbsp;report, Mkhwebane laid the charges against her predecessor after President Jacob Zuma complained about the release of the audio from his and Madonsela&rsquo;s interview on the state capture report. The newspaper reported that the charges were laid at the Brooklyn police station in Pretoria two weeks ago.At the time, the Presidency announced that it had &ldquo;sought clarity from the Office of the Public Protector on the policy of the institution regarding the release of audio recordings of interviews conducted during the course of investigations.Madonsela responded&nbsp;by saying that only the public protector &ldquo;has [the] right to decide&rdquo; on who or what is released to the public in terms of investigations. &ldquo;There is nothing that tells the [protector] this you may not give out and this you may give out,&rdquo; she was quoted as saying. She said it was a matter of deciding between two rights: the right to keep some matters confidential and the right to &ldquo;tell the truth and let the nation decide&rdquo;. In the 4-hour long recording Madonsela is heard painstakingly trying to wrestle answers from Zuma who had claimed that he needed legal advice before answering her questions or that it was not simply a matter of answering questions without applying his mind.But Madonsela was not swayed and wanted to know what difference it would make if he answered the questions on that day or any other day.But a determined Madonsela pressed Zuma on why he would need legal advise before answering her questions on why he hired and fired certain Cabinet ministers when he did not appear to need it when making those decisions.&ldquo;If we are starting with, for example, why did you remove [former Finance] Minister [Nhlanhla] Nene, why do you need somebody to legally advise you, because that is a decision you took yourself without legal advice? You took that decision, exercising your power as an Executive,&rdquo; she told him.
