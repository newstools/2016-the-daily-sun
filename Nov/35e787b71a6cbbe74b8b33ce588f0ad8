GOING to school has become very stressful for pupils at Dikwetse Primary School in Setebong Village, Limpopo.Their school was badly hit by a storm last year. Now the school is left with only three classrooms for 110 pupils. Grades R and 3 kids share a classroom. The toilet walls are also cracked. The pupils relieve themselves in nearby bushes.Pinky Mosipsa, a member of the school governing body, said they have lodged a complaint with the department of education.&ldquo;The department even asked us to take pictures of the damage, but the officials never came to inspect the school,&rdquo; Pinky told Daily Sun.&ldquo;When it rains, teachers are forced to send pupils home as they can&rsquo;t attend lessons in wet classrooms.&ldquo;In winter, it&rsquo;s better because there&rsquo;s no rain.&rdquo; Pinky said when they asked the department to organise mobile classrooms for the kids, they were told that the classrooms were very expensive and the department was running out of funds. Naledzana Rasila, spokesman for the Limpopo Education Department, said: &ldquo;We have more than 120 storm damaged schools around the province. &ldquo;We are addressing them through the infrastructure plan. &ldquo;However, it is not possible to address them all at once due to inadequate resources. &ldquo;They are being dealt with gradually.&rdquo;
