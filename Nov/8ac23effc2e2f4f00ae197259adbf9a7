KGOTSO Mofokeng was furious when his landlord recently gave him an ultimatum and demanded that he pay him extra money because he keeps chickens.The 38-year-old from Lenasia, Joburg, told Daily Sun: &ldquo;This man is mad. He expects me to pay R400 extra a month because of my animals. &ldquo;I explained to him before I moved into this yard that I own livestock, which I sell. Now he is telling me to pay extra money for them, which doesn&rsquo;t make sense.&rdquo; Kgotso said his landlord refused him permission to bring his chickens into the yard. He was forced to keep them outside, which led to residents stealing some of his birds. &ldquo;I had 13 chickens and I&rsquo;m left with only seven because people keep on stealing them. I&rsquo;m forced to stay up at night to watch over them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All of this because this man refuses to let me keep the chickens inside his yard without paying him. These chickens help take care of my family and I can&rsquo;t afford to have them stolen.&rdquo; Kgotso said he had tried everything to make his landlord understand his situation but he had no success. The SunTeam contacted the landlord, Jabulani Khoza (49), who said: &ldquo;I told him to find another place for his chickens because I don&rsquo;t want them in my yard. This isn&rsquo;t a farm. &ldquo;Other tenants complain about the smell and the noise the chickens make. I&rsquo;m not willing to lose tenants because of chickens. If he wants his chickens to stay in the yard, he must pay rent for them.&rdquo;
