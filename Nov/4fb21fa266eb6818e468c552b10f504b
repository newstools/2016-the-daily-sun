THERE is a thin line between love and hate!And nobody knows that better than 30-year-old Sanah Skhosana from Chris Hani, north of Tshwane. Not so long ago, Sanah was on cloud nine telling everyone that she had found the love of her life and they were going to get married. Today, she carries stab wounds inflicted by her lover and she is in hiding.The love of her life whom she met in 2013 has become her worst enemy. Sanah said: &ldquo;In the beginning he was a good guy who treated me like a queen. He was everything I wanted in a man. &ldquo;But a year into our relationship he turned into a monster. It got worse when he lost his job. He started calling me names and abused me physically and emotionally. One day I packed my bags and moved out of our rented room.&rdquo; Sanah said she was seven months pregnant at the time and her move fuelled his anger.&ldquo;He beat me so hard I lost the baby,&rdquo; she said. Sanah said she has lost all faith in being protected by the police.Constable Herman Moremi said cases of intimidation, assault and domestic violence have been opened.
