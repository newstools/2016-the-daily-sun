CLIFTON Hlalele has been in a coma since his clothing was caught by the side mirror of a moving truck at the beginning of August and he fell on his head. The 27-year-old general worker with the Rand West City Municipality in Gauteng was on the job when the accident occurred. He was on the truck to throw waste collected by other workers into it when his clothes got caught on the mirror. He was rushed to Leratong Hospital in Mogale City and has been moved to a number of other hospitals since then, but he&rsquo;s still in a coma. Clifton&rsquo;s brother, Mona Sekete (32), said: &ldquo;The truck was driving fast, causing my brother to be thrown down. He was seriously injured. He doesn&rsquo;t respond when we speak to him.&rdquo; Clifton signed an employment contract with the municipality in March and although it expired in June, he was still working. The SunTeam is in possession of the contract. It was signed with the Westonaria Municipality, which doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore as it merged with Randfontein in August to form Rand West City. Municipal spokesman Tshidiso Tlharipe told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We take note of this unfortunate incident that happened while the employee was on duty. We wish him a speedy recovery.&rdquo; He said the municipality would investigate the incident to determine how to avoid accidents in the future. The response angered Mona, who said: &ldquo;My brother has little chance of recovery. The municipality must pay for its negligence.&rdquo; Bekkersdal Police Sergeant Linki Lefakane said a case of negligent driving was opened for investigation.
