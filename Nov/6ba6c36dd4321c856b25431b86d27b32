LARGE and poisonous snakes have started to come out of hibernation in KZN. With the temperature rising with the start of summer, KZN Emergency Medical Services (EMS) has warned that this is normally the time when snakes become more active.A Mozambican spitting cobra was removed from a garden at a house in Reservoir Hills on Monday. And in Escombe a black mamba of 2,5 metres was removed from a house on Sunday.Robert Mckenzie, KZN EMS spokesman, said this was usually the time of the year they&rsquo;d get more calls for people who have been bitten by snakes in the province.&ldquo;Do not wait for symptoms to develop before seeking medical attention. Don&rsquo;t use a tight encircling band or belt around an arm or leg where bitten, as in the long run that can cause complications. &ldquo;Do not cut the bite area in an attempt to make it bleed. Don&rsquo;t try suck the venom out the wound and don&rsquo;t apply heat or cold packs to the bite area.&rdquo;He also warned that anti-venom has been developed to combat the effects of certain snakes&rsquo; venom. &ldquo;It is not effective against all snake venoms and therefore cannot just be administered as it may cause a life threatening anaphylactic reaction. &ldquo;Anti-venom, which is also very expensive, has a short shelf life. It needs to be kept refrigerated and needs to be administered by trained medical professionals in a controlled manner.&rdquo;He said when walking in a wilderness area, stick to the path and avoid grassy and bushy areas where snakes may hide. &ldquo;Try to wear boots, long pants and a long-sleeved shirt. Be careful when picking up objects that snakes may hide under. The classic example is logs, which are often sought as firewood.&rdquo;He also warned people not to try to catch or hit snakes with a stick. &ldquo;Most snakes can strike two thirds of their length when resting,&rdquo; he added.
