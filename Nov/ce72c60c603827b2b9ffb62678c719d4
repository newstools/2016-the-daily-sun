SKIPPER Steve Smith and his Australia team are under huge pressure, both from South Africa&rsquo;s Proteas and their own selectors, as they try to bounce back from one of their worst losing streaks in the second Test in Hobart tomorrow.The Australians sunk to a comprehensive 177-run loss to the Proteas in the series opener in Perth, with the team coming in for heavy criticism over their loss.South Africa were without their influential skipper AB de Villiers and lost pace spearhead Dale Steyn with a series-ending shoulder injury, yet still outplayed the home team.It was Australia&rsquo;s first loss in an opening Test of their home season in 28 years and they have now slumped to four straight defeats, after crashing in all three Tests on their July-August tour of Sri Lanka.&ldquo;I would say every spot is under pressure,&rdquo; Australian coach Darren Lehmann admitted, with Smith adding: &ldquo;Every aspect of our game needs improvement.&rdquo;The last time Australia lost four Tests in a row in India three years ago, then coach Mickey Arthur was sacked.Lehmann is not seen as being under the same pressure as Arthur, but Smith&rsquo;s captaincy has come under close scrutiny, with former SA captain Graeme Smith saying he looked &ldquo;a bit lost&rdquo; this week.While there could be up to three enforced team changes for Hobart with injuries to Shaun Marsh, Adam Voges and Peter Siddle, the entire Australian team is under the gun in every position ahead of the third day-night Test in Adelaide later this month.South Africa, although ranked fifth in Tests to Australia&rsquo;s third, were bowled to victory in Perth by electric young paceman Kagiso Rabada, who stepped up when Steyn suffered the shoulder injury on the second day.&ldquo;I am incredibly proud of him and I have a lot of respect for anyone who puts their hand up and does the hard yards,&rdquo; Proteas captain Faf du Plessis said of Rabada&rsquo;s staunch 31-over effort in Australia&rsquo;s second innings.South Africa recovered from a shaky first innings total of 242 to turn the Perth Test around. They triggered a first-innings collapse as Australia lost 10 wickets for 86, and then took control through centuries from JP Duminy and Dean Elgar.Australia, who have only lost once in 12 Tests at Hobart&rsquo;s Bellerive Oval, are likely to bring back Joe Burns for injured opener Marsh, while speedster Joe Mennie is expected to make his Test debut for the sidelined Siddle.Callum Ferguson may also get a start in the middle order if Voges does not recover in time from hamstring trouble in the five-day turnaround from Perth.Complicating Australia&rsquo;s predicament. rain has been forecast for the first three days in Hobart in a game they must win to take the three-Test series to a decider in Adelaide on 24 November.
