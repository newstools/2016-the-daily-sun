MAMAKGOWA Valashiya (32) and her lover Bonginkosi Gina (51) were living together happily with their little kid when death snatched Bonginkosi away in October.But now he haunts her dreams. Mamakgowa said it was because cops wouldn&rsquo;t allow her to bury her dead lover. Cops said his family should collect his body but Mamakgowa has no idea who his family is, other than that they&rsquo;re from Mtubatuba in KZN.Mamakgowa, from Nyakallong near Allanridge, claimed Bonginkosi visited her in her dreams twice last week and looked very angry. She said every time she woke up terrified and sweating. She said the dead man&rsquo;s spirit has so far not said anything to her, but she believes that he wasn&rsquo;t resting in peace as his body is still lying in the mortuary. Mamakgowa said they have been living together for six years, but never married. Police told her that since they were not married, she was not allowed to bury him.Heartbroken Mamakgowa said they were planning to get married in December. She added that she had often pleaded with Bonginkosi to visit his relatives in KZN but he always told her that he was too embarrassed to go home after leaving his former girlfriend and their son 23 years ago. Police spokesman Captain Stephen Thakeng said they couldn&rsquo;t allow Mamakgowa to bury Bonginkosi to avoid family conflicts. He said if Mamakgowa failed to trace his relatives, permission to bury him could be given to her. Otherwise he will be given a pauper&rsquo;s burial. Thakeng asked people with information about Bonginkosi &rsquo;s relatives to call Warrant Officer Spider Molete on 057 452 3800 during office hours or Mamakgowa on 073 129 1778.
