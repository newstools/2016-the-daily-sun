THE 2016/17 MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC) has reached the halfway mark, with Mamelodi Sundowns leading the pack.The Brazilians will today host Bidvest Wits at TUT Stadium in a game that will determine if they stay on top of the log or Wits reclaim the number one spot.Wits have been dominating the MDC since the start of the season, but all that came to an end when they suffered their first (2-1) defeat to Bloemfontein Celtic a fourth night ago.Rookies, Highlands Park, are also having a season to remember on their first stint in the MDC. They host Celtic at Makhulong Stadium (12pm).Highlands have done well so far, unlike fellow rookies Baroka FC, without a win in seven games.Highlands lost their first match last weekend, when they were trashed 3-0 by Sundowns, but their mentor, Les Grobler, said they would bounce back.Said Grobler: &ldquo;Last weekend we had a good game, but lost because we were not clinical enough in front of goal. We made a lot of individuals mistakes upfront and we were too relaxed. It was a learning curve for the boys. We need to pick up the pieces going forward and ensure we don&rsquo;t lose our second match in a row.
