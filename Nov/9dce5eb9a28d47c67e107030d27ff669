Kaizer Chiefs have hailed the influence of the successful team of the 1970s in terms of building the club into the giant it is today in South African football.Chiefs were founded in January 1970 and the star-studded team at the time went on to win numerous trophies during the early days of the organised professional era.Famously, the Glamour Boys from that time were made up of names such as Ace Ntsoelengoe, Computer Lamola, Banks Setlhodi, Shaka Ngcobo, Ryder Mofokeng, Pele Blaschke and Bizzah Dlamini.As such, Amakhosi have heralded the contribution made by some of these legends towards a club that is widely regarded as one of the biggest in Mzansi today.Chairman Kaizer Motaung told the club's official website: "We are all standing on the shoulders of players like Ten-Ten Nzimande."They are the founding fathers. If Chiefs didn't have the success we had in those early years, I don't know where we would be today."
