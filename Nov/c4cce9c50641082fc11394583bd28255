A TAXI driver has been sentenced to life behind bars for raping a woman passenger two years ago.On Thursday, the Mqanduli Regional Court agreed with the State to bestow the heavy sentence on Simbonile Mbokothwana (25) for failing to show guilt after abusing his role as a transport provider.The victim, who now is 21 years old, was on her way home from Elliotdale Clinic on 3 September 2014. The only taxi available was the one driven by Simbonile. He drove past her stop and then promised to drop her after the last passenger. But instead, Simbonile took her to his home, where he raped her three times before ordering her to leave early in the morning.She then walked over 10km to her home and told her uncle of what had happened. He became a key witness in the lengthy trial.Simbonile first pleaded not guilty, claiming the sex was consensual. He even called three witnesses he claimed were present at the time, but they all contradicted him and he was found guilty.Prosecutor Melikhaya Dyakopu pleaded with the court to sentence the accused to life because he did not show any remorse even though he had targeted a young woman who trusted him. He argued the court should send a strong message that any violence and anarchy at taxi ranks cannot be tolerated. Magistrate Bonginkosi Mene sentenced Simbonile to life. The NPA&rsquo;s Luxolo Tyali said the sentence would send the message that violence against women and children won&rsquo;t be tolerated.
