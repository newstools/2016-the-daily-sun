Haley (19) was featured on the Dr Phil show on Wednesday to ask for support from the American public for the child she claims she will soon be giving birth to ... Jesus! Haley&rsquo;s plea for support is because her family not only don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s going to give birth to the son of God, they don&rsquo;t even believe she&rsquo;s pregnant. According to the Cosmopolitan Magazine, Haley has had six negative pregnancy tests.&nbsp; But on Dr Phil&rsquo;s show, Haley insists she is giving birth to the son of God and is nine months pregnant. She expects to give birth next week. &ldquo;I know my pregnancy is real. I&rsquo;ve gained at least 9,5kgs,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was sleeping one night and my baby punched the bottom of my stomach and kicked me, and I can feel his head right here, right below my belly button.&rdquo; &ldquo;My family, my friends, my pastors at church, they don&rsquo;t believe that I&rsquo;m pregnant,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s Jesus. I don&rsquo;t care if my family disowns me. It really comes down to if you&rsquo;re a true believer in Jesus or not &hellip; I don&rsquo;t care what the home pregnancy test or a doctor says, when I give birth to my baby, no one is going to deny him because he&rsquo;s my saviour.&rdquo; Haley's mum and sister think she is mad.&nbsp; Her mum mentions in a video clip that Haley is a compulsive liar and wants attention.
