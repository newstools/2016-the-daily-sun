FORMER Orlando Pirates head coach, Muhsin Ertugral, will be taking a break following his shock departure from the Buccaneers this week.Speaking to SunSport, the Turkish-born coach said he was leaving for Istanbul next week where he will be doing TV work for local Turkish stations and will be attending to his family business interests there.Said Ertugral: &ldquo;I have TV appearances lined up and have a business that needs to be attended to. I&rsquo;ll also be visiting my family in Turkey.&rdquo;He leaves Pirates with a heavy heart, but had no hard feelings towards anyone at the club following his sensational resignation on live TV last Tuesday night. This after Bucs were thrashed 6-1 by SuperSport United in an Absa Premiership fixture.Said Ertugral: &ldquo;I want to take a break now. I&rsquo;m sorry things didn&rsquo;t work out with Pirates.&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a great club and I wish them well. There are no bad feelings. As a coach, you always know you&rsquo;re the driver and realise that it&rsquo;s not working out. My track record in South Africa speaks for itself.&rdquo;Ertugral thanked chairman Irvin Khoza, saying: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s done wonders for the PSL and local soccer. I&rsquo;ve great respect for him.&rdquo; Khoza said coaching a club like Pirates is not easy.&ldquo;There are a lot of pressures that come with the job,&rdquo; he said.Ertugral is regarded as one of the best foreign-born coaches to have worked in the PSL and had success with clubs like Kaizer Chiefs and Ajax Cape Town.In 2001 he won every cup competition with Amakhosi, including the African Cup Winners Cup also know as the Mandela Cup in 2001.So successful was Ertugral that season the club&rsquo;s then PRO, Putco Mafani, coined the phrase &ldquo;Operation Vat Alles&rdquo; &ndash; Operation Take Everything.The only trophy that eluded Ertugral that season was the league title.Ertugral said he&rsquo;s in no hurry to get a new coaching job. &ldquo;I have had feelers from clubs in Turkey, but I&rsquo;ll take a rest and enjoy time with my family.&rdquo; Meanwhile, Khoza gave his players a tongue lashing midweek after the 6-1 defeat and Ertugral&rsquo;s departure. He told players he never wants to see such poor display ever again, and stressed he wanted success when Bucs celebrate their 80th anniversary next year.
