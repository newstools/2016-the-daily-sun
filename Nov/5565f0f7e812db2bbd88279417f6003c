MAMELODI Sundowns trio &ndash; Khama Billiat, Keagan Dolly and Leonard Castro &ndash; are back to haunt Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs.The highly-anticipated Absa Premiership showdown is billed for Loftus Stadium tomorrow (3.30pm)Their deadly &ldquo;CBD&rdquo; combination, which normally gives opposing PSL clubs serious headaches, was cut short when Castro sustained an ankle injury in August.Billiat yesterday revealed that Castro&rsquo;s return to action was a huge boost for the African Champions in their bid to catch up with early pacesetters Bidvest Wits.Downs are second from bottom on four points from three games and only a point separates them from basement side Ajax Cape Town. They are 12 points behind the Clever Boys who are one point ahead of Amakhosi with two games in hand. Wits have played six matches. &ldquo;We missed him a lot,&rdquo; said Billiat as he told how good Castro was when in possession.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have much height going forward and he is good aerially. We really need his presence because he can score goals any time. &ldquo;He is looking sharp at training and he will surely add value.Added Billiat: &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s up to the coach. If he feels Castro is ready to play, then we will be happy to have him. We will work together and make the best of his abilities.&rdquo; Billiat stressed that they wouldn&rsquo;t get carried away by Amakhosi&rsquo;s failure to win their past two league games.Chiefs drew goalless with rivals Orlando Pirates and were held by PSL rookies Baroka FC by the same margin.Explained Billiat: &ldquo;Chiefs are a good team and can hurt you from any angle. We just need to stay focused and ensure we don&rsquo;t concede.&rdquo; However, the Zimbabwean player said he was aware that it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to return to the top.&ldquo;We are ready to be back in contention for the league. It will be hard, but we need to show character and professionalism. We can&rsquo;t afford to drop any more points.&rdquo;Coach Pitso Mosimane said Castro wasn&rsquo;t guaranteed the entire 90 minutes: &ldquo;I will give him about 20 minutes and then we&rsquo;ll see how it goes.&rdquo;He admitted that he hoped the clash would re-ignite his players&rsquo; form. &ldquo;I am struggling to raise the appetite level of the players from winning the Champions League and anticipating the World Cup champs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a psychologist and I don&rsquo;t know what to say to them. I&rsquo;m trying my best. I don&rsquo;t know if it works or not. &ldquo;But against Chiefs you know levels will rise because egos and bragging rights are there.&rdquo; Mosimane expressed his concern about fatigue and injuries to other key players and blamed Bafana Bafana coaches Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba and Owen Da Gama for overloading them.&ldquo;Kennedy (Mweene) still has a groin injury, Laffor (Anthony) didn&rsquo;t train because he is tired. Dolly is cramping from Bafana&rsquo;s game.&ldquo;Mabunda (Tiyani) is tired after he played two games for the national side. I don&rsquo;t think he will play on Saturday. &ldquo;So who gets the short end of the stick? Sundowns. &ldquo;Why did Langerman (Tebogo) come out of the Bafana camp? Because of a hamstring injury due to overloading.&rdquo;
