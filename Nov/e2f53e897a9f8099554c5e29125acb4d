THE mum loved her two sons and couldn&rsquo;t bear to see them die in front of her. So when thugs came to ambush her children in her yard, she gave her life to protect them. The thugs shot the mum dead instead of her sons! Captain Solomon Sibiya said the victim was at her house in Kagiso, west of Joburg earlier this month when her two sons, aged 17 and 22, came running into the yard. &ldquo;Suddenly four unknown men entered the yard. The mum asked them what they were looking for and one of the men threatened to kill one of her sons,&rdquo; said Sibiya. He said the thugs left but returned later that evening. The mum approached the suspects and asked them why they had come into her yard with a firearm. &ldquo;The men then fired five shots at her while her sons were locked in the house. &ldquo;She was certified dead on the scene. A neighbour who was also in the yard was shot in the foot. She was taken to a local hospital where she was treated,&rdquo; said Sibiya.He said the police traced the suspects to Nancefield Hostel in Soweto. One suspect was arrested and the firearm used to shoot the mum was recovered. The man was detained at Kagiso Police Station. The boys told the police they were chased by the men for peeing on someone&rsquo;s wall. &ldquo;The siblings ran away but they were followed to their home,&rdquo; said Sibiya.
