ZANELE Magwentshu was known for her delicious cooking.But on Sunday her skills in the kitchen cost the 50-year-old from Mofolo Village in Soweto her life! She was shot dead after getting into a fight with a thug over a plate of food. Her husband, Fezekile Magwentshu, said the trouble started the previous night when a man arrived at their home, where they sold food, at about 10pm. &ldquo;He ordered a plate of food but after my wife gave it to him, he pulled out a gun and refused to pay. Zanele screamed at him and he walked away,&rdquo; said Fezekile. &ldquo;We followed him and demanded our money. He then pulled out his gun again and shot at us four times. Luckily, it was dark and he missed.&rdquo; But the man returned the next day and this time he didn&rsquo;t miss his target. Fezekile said: &ldquo;I had gone to the yard opposite our house to get a beer. As I was coming back, I saw someone entering my yard. I heard gunshots soon afterwards. &ldquo;I tried to hit the man with a bottle as he came out but he blocked it with his gun and managed to get away. I rushed into the yard, where I found my wife dead. She had been shot in the head twice.&rdquo; Constable John Serala of Moroka Police Station said the suspect was believed to have fled to Jabulani Hostel in Dannhauser, KZN.&ldquo;The man is wanted for murder. Anyone who knows where he is should call Warrant Officer Mbuzeni Kwinda on 072 225 8452,&rdquo; Serala said.
