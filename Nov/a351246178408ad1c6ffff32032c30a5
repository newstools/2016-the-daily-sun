MAPASEKA Letsike, the South African National Aids Council deputy chairman, said it was unacceptable that in 2016 there were still 290 000 new HIV infections annually.He said HIV/Aids could be eradicated by 2030 but only if every sector of society worked together.The Aids Council held a meeting at the Sheraton Hotel in Tshwane on Friday.Letsike said there are 2 000 new infections per week among girls between 15 and 24 in South Africa. &ldquo;We can no longer afford that.

They should go to school and stay there.&ldquo;We can no longer have pregnancies among teens, especially when we know about the inter-generational issues.&rdquo; Letsike said he is committed to the new strategic plan to eradicate HIV/Aids by 2030. The meeting was chaired by deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa.He urged all South Africans to work towards the new plan.Ramaphosa said he is looking forward to a generation free of HIV.
