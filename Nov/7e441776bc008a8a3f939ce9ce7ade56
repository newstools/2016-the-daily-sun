THE gogo was pulling out weeds in the garden at the creche when she felt something slither up her hand.She bent down for a closer look &ndash; and her heart almost stopped.She got the shock of her life when she realised she was touching a huge python!Gogo Rachael Nkuna (64), from Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, dropped her gardening tools and leapt backwards in terror. The serpent slithered further into the tall grass. Gogo Rachel&rsquo;s terrified screams drew the attention of the teachers and pupils in the classrooms. They arrived just in time to see the snake slipping deeper into the tall grass, and a stampede ensued as pupils feared even more snakes could be lurking in the garden.A shocked teacher said they decided to keep the little ones in class while they waited for the municipality&rsquo;s fire and rescue team. The rescuers caught the snake minutes after their arrival.&ldquo;We had no option but to keep the toddlers locked up until the rescue team arrived and caught the python,&rdquo; said the teacher.But Cockroach Mdluli from Bushbuckridge Municipality&rsquo;s fire and rescue team rescued the python.Speaking for the municipality, fire and rescue chief officer Rexon Silinda said the python is still young and about 2,1 metres long.&ldquo;The rainy season has started. &ldquo;Residents, especially those living near rivers and valleys, are warned to look out for hungry reptiles,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We believe the python&rsquo;s partner could show up soon.&rdquo;The python has been taken to the Kruger National Park.
