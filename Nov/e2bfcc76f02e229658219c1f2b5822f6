EASTERN Cape Department of Health officials are searching for seven mentally ill patients who disappeared on Monday. The missing patients were left unguarded during an unprotected strike by dozens of Mafoko security company guards.Female guards accused supervisors of demanding sexual favours from them.Health department spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said: &ldquo;Seven mentally ill patients absconded following security unrest at Dora Nginza and Livingstone hospitals. The security guards are striking against their company, not the department.&rdquo;The guards were ordered to go back to work yesterday but refused, saying the company ignored their grievances. Phunyezwa Ndzekoza, National Security and Unqualified Workers&rsquo; Union shop steward, told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We were supposed to have a meeting with management, but they only brought us fried chicken and drinks and told us to go back to work.&ldquo;We refused. And what made us even more angry is that the two sex pests who were suspended are back at work today. The company also brought in guards from Bloemfontein instead of talking to us. They only gave us two hours to return to work.&ldquo;One of the directors from national office even told us that &lsquo;you open your legs, you win&rsquo;,&rdquo; claimed Ndzekoza.Daily Sun tried to get comment from Mafoko security company, but were told managers were locked in a meeting with hospital officials.
