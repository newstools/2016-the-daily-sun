Ajax Cape Town striker Nathan Paulse has expressed confidence that his team is back on track in the Premiership after ending their winless streak.The Urban Warriors grabbed their first win of the season in the 3-2 victory over Platinum Stars last weekend moving them off the bottom of the table."Look, it was a good win over Stars and the boys deserve all the credit for the hard work and their attitude," Paulse said on the club's website."It was a much needed win as it brought some relief in the camp. The guys are now starting to believe in themselves which is good for the club."The win has given the entire squad that needed boost. We still have a long way to go though, but this is a good start. As we prepare for the big clash against Mamelodi Sundowns, I believe the boys will be in high spirits and ensure they get another win."The Mother City club will take on Sundowns at the Cape Town Stadium on Wednesday.
