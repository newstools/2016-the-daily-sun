THEY were thugs, and Louis Makamo (23) knew this because he could hear them discussing the items they intended to steal from his neighbour&rsquo;s house.But then one of them spotted Louis and fired as many as 10 shots in his direction. They all missed. Louis did not know that one thug had sneaked up around him. He hacked Louis with an iron bar on the head and left him for dead.But Louis, from Joe Slovo near Komatipoort in Mpumalanga, was not dead and managed to crawl to safety. He is happy he lived to tell the story.&ldquo;I was on my way to the shop to buy a light bulb on Saturday evening. Before I could even reach the store, I heard a group of men arguing in my neighbour&rsquo;s yard,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They were discussing the heavy load they would have to carry if they took the laptop, plasma TV and other goods. I realised that they were thieves, so I hid behind a tree and continued to watch their evil deeds.&rdquo; But the thugs spotted him and opened fire. Louis counted at least 10 gunshots before feeling a terrible pain at the back of his head.He lost consciousness.&ldquo;I woke up in a pool of blood and there were people around me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was told I managed to crawl to safety and the people rushed me to hospital. I am lucky to be alive. All I want is to move on and focus on my healing so I can go back to work.&rdquo; The neighbour whose house was burgled has gone into hiding, fearing more attacks. Resident Maria Sithole (66) said Louis was lucky he was not killed. &ldquo;We are helpless in this village because thugs steal even in broad daylight,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They are not scared to kill &ndash; they have guns.&rdquo;Lieutenant Mzwandile Nyambi said Louis should come to the police station to open a case. He said if he is scared that something will happen to him, protection will be provided.
