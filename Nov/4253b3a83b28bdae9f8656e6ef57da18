LEFA Tsapi claimed he raised his son alone Lesotho after he was divorced from his wife.But when he sent his son to Mzansi to study, the youngster was reunited with his mum and has turned his back on his father. And now it has become so bad, he doesn&rsquo;t even want his royal inheritance!&ldquo;It breaks my heart that my only son wants nothing to do with me after everything I have done for him. &ldquo;I came all the way from Lesotho to try and resolve matters with him, but he refuses to even talk to me,&rdquo; Lefa claimedwhen he visited our offices in Joburg. &ldquo;After my marriage failed, my ex moved back to South Africa. &ldquo;I stayed with my son and as a single parent I raised him in Lesotho.&ldquo;He finished school in Lesotho and I sent him to South Africa to further his studies in 2009.&ldquo;That proved to be the biggest mistake I ever made,&rdquo; said Lefa.&ldquo;His attitude started changing when he reunited with his mum.&ldquo;All I want is for us to sit down and talk about the matter like men. I want him to tell me to my face that he wants nothing to do with me, rather than ignore my calls.&rdquo;Daily Sun contacted Lefuno Tsapi, who said: &ldquo;I have nothing to say to that man.&ldquo;I am happy where I am and I do not want to discuss my personal life in the media.&rdquo;
