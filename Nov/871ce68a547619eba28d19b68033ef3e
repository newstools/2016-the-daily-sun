WHEN Valito Sithole decided to walk home after a happy night with his friends, no one had any clue he would soon be dead. A man was furious to be woken up by Valito and his friend as they walked past his house. So the 35-year-old stabbed him to death before dumping him in a yard! Valito&rsquo;s friend Samuel Sindane (23) said they had been drinking at a tavern in Freedom Park, south of Joburg, on Friday night. &ldquo;Earlier, we were involved in a fight with a man who was beating his girlfriend. We asked him to take the woman home to sleep and went to drink somewhere else,&rdquo; he said. Another friend said a woman complained that Valito and his friend had woken her up as they walked past her house. &ldquo;A tenant came out of her yard and fought with Valito. I walked away and only heard the next day that Valito&rsquo;s body had been found in another yard with multiple stab wounds,&rdquo; he said. Valito&rsquo;s sister, Julia Mathusi (40), said one of his friends came to her door on Saturday morning to say Valito had been killed. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. He was lying in a pool of blood. I had spoken to him earlier. He promised to visit me later,&rdquo; she said. Police spokesman Captain Philemon Khorombi confirmed that a case of murder was opened.
