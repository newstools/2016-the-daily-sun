ZUKISWA Mhlakaza is furious with her neighbour, who she said spilled kak all over her yard yesterday. The 49-year-old blind woman from Freedom Square squatter camp in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun the incident was sparked by a fight over mobile toilets. &ldquo;Last month the municipality delivered new mobile toilets to us. I was not given one. I usually get a special toilet, but this time I was forced to use my old one,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The problem is that when the truck comes to clean the toilets, they only focus on the new ones. My toilet was full and I needed to relieve myself. I used my neighbour&rsquo;s toilet thinking she wouldn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo; Little did she know that her neighbour did mind and all hell broke loose. Her neighbour, Nonkululeko Shabangu, became very angry when she discovered that Zukiswa had used her toilet and poured the contents of it out in her yard. Nonkululeko said: &ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m angry. How could this woman just dump her shit in my toilet without talking to me? I was just returning what belongs to her.&rdquo; Sipho Mbetse of the municipality said: &ldquo;We are aware of Zukiswa&rsquo;s toilet problem. We are doing our best to deal with it. Her councillor will visit her at home and attend to her needs. We promised that she will have a special toilet by the end of the week.&rdquo;
