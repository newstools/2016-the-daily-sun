WHEN taxi drivers start praying, you know things are bad!After two weeks of fatal crashes on Main Reef Road, the west of Joburg, taxi drivers yesterday gathered to ask for help from God and the ancestors.They burned incense and sprinkled snuff on the ground to appease the spirits of those who had died. Mpho Muthaki, chairman of Dorljota Taxi Association, said: &ldquo;These past two weeks have been hell. We have witnessed several accidents and many people dying on the spot.&ldquo;Tuesday is now known as doomsday because two fatal accidents happened on Tuesday for the past two weeks. Too many lives have been lost on this road. We want it to stop. It&rsquo;s painful to see family members coming to identify their loved ones. &ldquo;We have also lost drivers. Their families are traumatised,&rdquo; said Mpho.Mpho expressed relief over the fact that it rained while they were praying. He said it was a sign that God and the ancestors were listening.As the smell of incense filled the air and traditional beer and snuff was sprinkled on the ground, taxi drivers held candles and prayed.Madala Azwindini Nemuthanzela (70), a taxi driver, said: &ldquo;Put your candles up and pray to God. Times are tough and it&rsquo;s going to get worse as the festive season approaches. &ldquo;I pray the spirits of those who died on this road do not come back to claim more lives.&rdquo;The drivers went to three spots where accidents frequently happened. Azwindini also prayed that the Lord would protect all the drivers on the road.
