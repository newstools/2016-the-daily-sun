ESKOM CEO Brian Molefe broke down in tears while trying to explain his links to the Guptas yesterday. Molefe was speaking in Joburg during Eskom&rsquo;s interim results announcement. He was implicated in the public protector&rsquo;s State Capture report, which noted that he had been in the Saxonwold area of Joburg, where the Gupta family lives, 14 times. The report also revealed there has been 58 telephone calls between him and a Gupta representative between last August and March. Molefe complained that former public protector Thuli Madonsela never gave him the opportunity to tell his side of the story. He said she had told him he would get an opportunity to defend himself but later went back on her promise. He said he was subpoenaed and was ready to speak to Madonsela but instead she asked for 125 files, which were given to her. &ldquo;We never appeared in front of the public protector. She sent us questions. What surprises me is that they said I was in Saxonwold 14 times. My cellphone reflects I was in the area. There&rsquo;s a shebeen two streets away from the Guptas. I will not admit or deny I&rsquo;ve gone to the shebeen because my wife doesn&rsquo;t know there&rsquo;s a shebeen there, but there is a shebeen there,&rdquo; said tearful Molefe. He said he would have enjoyed the opportunity to answer Madonsela&rsquo;s questions but he would now have the opportunity to present facts to a commission of inquiry. &ldquo;In my case, the Public Protector painted me with a corrupt brush. There will be a commission of inquiry and the results will be known in another 18 months. During that period, my children will be taunted at school.&rdquo;
