ANY hope that the gang fight in the Vaal would end soon has been shattered.A picture has appeared on social media of a man&rsquo;s chopped 4-5. He is believed to be one of the rival gangs in the area.The skin of the 4-5 is peeled back to reveal the flesh, apparently as revenge for the horror killings that have been happening in the kasi lately. The picture appeared just hours after Daily Sun reported the death of a gang leader who was killed on Sunday in Bophelong, Vaal. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Gertrude Makhala said they were not aware of the specific incident, and no case was reported.On Tuesday, residents held a meeting at the local sports grounds to try and find a solution. Many said the police were not doing enough, and they were ready to take the law into their own hands.A community leader said: &ldquo;Cops should be leading the fight against crime, but today we are in a meeting with one policeman and patrollers.&ldquo;We wanted to talk about the lack of police visibility in the kasi.&rdquo; He said there should be no initiations in the kasi this year, as this seemed to be the cause of the gang violence.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t feel safe here. These kids are armed.&rdquo; The gang war is between the Diamonds from Movhango and the Mopheme gang, originally from Tshirela.Sergeant Makhala said: &ldquo;Three suspects appeared in court yesterday for murder and arson, but two were released on bail. &ldquo;The suspects will appear in court again next month.&rdquo;
