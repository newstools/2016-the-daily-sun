BAFANA Bafana coach Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba silenced his critics when he led Bafana to a crucial 2-1 victory over Senegal in their 2018 World Cup qualifiers at the Peter Mokaba Stadium yesterday. Mashaba, who desperately needed to win this game to hold onto his job, spent the week convincing people that Bafana are capable of beating any team on the African continent. Mashaba endured a lot of criticism when he failed to guide Bafana to the Gabon 2017 Africa Cup of Nations finals. With this win Bafana breathed life into their World Cup campaign as they now sit on top of the log with four points two ahead of Senegal after a round of two matches. Skipper Thulani Hlatshwayo and Thulani Serero grabbed the goals in a dominant first half. Cheikhou Kouyate pulled one back late in the second half, but Bafana held out for an important win. Bafana were backed by a near capacity crowed and the huge support from the stands played a huge role in their impressive win. The West African powerhouse are the overwhelming favourites to book their ticket to Russia ahead of Bafana, Cape Verde Island and Burkina Faso in group D. With a galaxy of stars such as Stoke City&rsquo;s Mame Biram Diouf, Sadio Mane of Liverpool, Everton&rsquo;s Idrissa Gueye and West Ham United&rsquo;s star Cheikhou Kouyate, who ply their trade in the English Premiership. The Lions of Teranga are the only team that boosts a 100% qualifying record from the Gabon 2017 Afcon qualifying rounds. They won all their six matches and they are currently an on-form team in the continent, but Bafana showed them no respect despite all their recent records.
