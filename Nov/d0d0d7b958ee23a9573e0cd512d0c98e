PHILIP says his body shows his journey in life.&ldquo;I write my stories on my skin,&rdquo; he told Daily Sun. Philip Kuton (21) from Newtown, Joburg has tattoos all over his body, except on his back and 4-5. &ldquo;I reserve down there for my girlfriend Lerato Moagi, who is a tattoo artist, to draw a memorable symbol,&rdquo; he said. He got his first four tattoos when he was 14.&ldquo;I went for Japanese Kanji symbols to reflect the depth of the world. I have two on my chest and one on each shoulder. They represent good and evil.&rdquo; He began visiting tattoo studios to find out how the industry worked. At 18 he joined Star Street Ink, led by Keenan Chengapar, to learn how to do tattoos. Today he runs his own tattoo studio and gallery called Last African Pirate.&ldquo;We do tattoos, painting, clothing, music and other art.&rdquo; He said a new tattoo gives the receiver instant pain and joy. The most common tattoo people ask for is praying hands.&ldquo;My weirdest experience was when a prostitute asked me to draw a 6 and a 9 on her bum,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I give permanent memories to people,&rdquo; he said.
