PLATINUM Stars are turning into a charity organisation! That is the view of their angry coach, Cavin Johnson, who wants to put an end to his side&rsquo;s charitable habits in matches. Dikwena have lost back-to-back home matches, 1-0 to Bidvest Wits and 3-2 to Ajax Cape Town, in the short period of seven days. Johnson blames their defeats on player mentality and wants them to shape up or ship out, before it&rsquo;s too late. The North West based Stars are 10th in the table with nine points from nine games. They have won two games, drawn three and lost four. At the rate Dikwena are going, the outlook could quickly become very bleak for Johnson and his young team. Goalkeeper Mbongeni Mzimela further upset Johnson with his needless sending-off against the Clever Boys. And against the Urban Warriors, Dikwena conceded three goals within 15 minutes as a result of pathetic defending, said the coach. Johnson said: &ldquo;We are turning into a more of a charity with each passing game. We gifted Baroka FC their first win (TKO on 23 October) and now we&rsquo;ve gifted Ajax their first win of the season. We will end up giving every team a Christmas present in the form of three points &ndash; and I want that to stop. &ldquo;We are making silly mistakes. I expect my players to be mentally strong but they aren&rsquo;t right now. Against Wits we gave away an unnecessary penalty, got a red card and lost.&rdquo; Dikwena visit struggling Free State Stars next Wednesday and Johnson is hoping for a better dose of fortune. But he insists he has the full backing of team management as his side rides out the rough patch. The former SuperSport United coach promoted nine academy players to the first team. Johnson added: &ldquo;We will beef up the squad in January. But for now the players must pull up their socks. I&rsquo;m looking over my shoulder &ndash; but we will get past this terrible run of form.&rdquo;
