SENIOR ANC MP Dr Mathole Motshekga has ruled out using a vote of no confidence in Parliament to get rid of President Jacob Zuma. This is despite the fact that Motshekga recently wrote a very critical open letter calling on Zuma to do the right thing and step down following the release of the State Capture report. Parliament is scheduled to debate a vote of no confidence against Zuma this week after the DA tabled the motion. However, it was not included in Parliament&rsquo;s diary and the DA has threatened to take legal action. Motshekga yesterday told Daily Sun the removal of Zuma should be left to the ANC&rsquo;s leadership and not Parliament, as it is an internal matter. &ldquo;The ANC must first offer him an opportunity to resign and use his conscience. If he is not prepared to go, the ANC leadership must take responsibility and recall him,&rdquo; said Motshekga. Zuma hit out at his critics in the party over the weekend, saying some of them didn&rsquo;t belong to any structures. He also said he was not scared of being jailed as he had been to prison before. Zuma appears to have the backing of party deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte, who told City Press the president would finish his term. She said Zuma should be given a chance to respond to the report. However, Motshekga said: &ldquo;The people want answers and we must give them answers. &ldquo;Zuma was deployed by the ANC, so it&rsquo;s not up to him whether he stays or goes.&rdquo;He called for an urgent NEC meeting to discuss Zuma&rsquo;s fate and said he was confident members would look at the facts revealed in the State Capture report.
