NOT only is he accused of stealing land, he is allegedly also threatening people &ndash; and the residents say they&rsquo;ve had enough.The people of Kgabalatsane near Hebron, North West said they can&rsquo;t stand by and watch as the man steals their land.Angry resident Yvonne Pooe (45) said the man, John Sirimane, was selling stands to people without residents&rsquo; approval.&ldquo;The residents called a community meeting and invited the police because we do not want to take the law into our own hands,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;But the police are protecting this man and don&rsquo;t take any steps against him.&rdquo;Yvonne said their lives were at risk. &ldquo;John told us we would regret reporting him to the police.&rdquo;She claimed he was selling the land and keeping the money for himself.&ldquo;Some people told me that they have paid R8 000 for stands and they won&rsquo;t move.&rdquo; said Yvonne. She said they would demolish the shacks the people had built on the land.&ldquo;This land belongs to us. We inherited it from our forefathers. There is no way we will allow this man to take what&rsquo;s ours.&rdquo;John told Daily Sun the allegations were false. He said he sold used tyres, bricks and sand.&ldquo;People complain that my tyres smell badly when it&rsquo;s hot. How can tyres cause a bad smell? It seems the people are jealous.&rdquo;He said residents even burnt all his tyres and that he didn&rsquo;t have any stock. He said the matter of the land went to court but the people had no facts.&ldquo;The case was withdrawn. These people must stay away from me,&rdquo; he said. North West Police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone confirmed that the case was withdrawn in court.
