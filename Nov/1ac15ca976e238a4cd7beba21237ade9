PORTIA Mohale (41) wants to set the record straight.&ldquo;My son, Kamogelo Mohale, is a male and not a female,&rdquo; she said. Not only does her son&rsquo;s birth certificate states that he is a girl, most of the information on the certificate is wrong as well. &ldquo;I was so happy when my son was born because I always wanted a boy,&rdquo; Portia told Daily Sun.&ldquo;We followed all the right procedures to make sure he got his birth certificate, but we were shocked to discover that the information on the certificate was wrong, including his gender and date of birth.&rdquo;She said the errors have caused a lot of disruption in his life. Portia said she has been trying for years to get the problem sorted out.Kamogelo is now six years old and is supposed to be going to school but he can&rsquo;t because he does not have a legitimate birth certificate. &ldquo;I first went to the Home Affairs in Harrison Street, Joburg, where I was told that I needed to go to the main offices in Pretoria. But when I got there, they told me their system still had the wrong information and I had to wait for eight weeks. But it has been years without any solution,&rdquo; she said.Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said he would take Portia&rsquo;s details and forward the matter to the provincial manager who will look into it. &ldquo;We will try to find out how her son&rsquo;s gender was mixed up and fix the problem,&rdquo; he said.
