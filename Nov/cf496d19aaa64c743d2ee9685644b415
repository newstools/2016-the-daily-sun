WHEN he went home to see his wife, he did not expect to find her body lying in a pool of blood. Johannes Tseki (51) was horrified to find his wife had been brutally murdered when he arrived at his home in Sharpeville, Vaal, on Sunday morning. He realised something was wrong when he walked into the kitchen and saw two of his wristwatches on the counter there. When he entered the bedroom he found his wife, Malehlohonolo (47) lying naked on the bed. She had been stabbed 11 times in her upper body. Johannes told Daily Sun: &ldquo;When I got home in the early hours of the morning, I saw the bottom part of the door was broken. I was then horrified when I found my wife&rsquo;s body lying in a pool of blood. &ldquo;I could not believe my eyes when I saw so many holes in her body. I am deeply traumatised and I do not understand how this happened.&rdquo; His distraught daughter, Dilahlwane (26) said the thug might have broken the door to get into the house. &ldquo;Community members said they saw my mum sitting outside in the yard on Sunday. They said she was with an unknown man.&ldquo;She locked the door and it&rsquo;s obvious that the thug couldn&rsquo;t take anything because he got in through a hole at the bottom of the door and left the same way. We don&rsquo;t know who would have done such a horrible thing. We are traumatised by this.&rdquo; Warrant Officer Simon Mofokatsane said a case of murder was opened at the Sharpeville cop shop for investigation, and no arrest had been made as yet.
