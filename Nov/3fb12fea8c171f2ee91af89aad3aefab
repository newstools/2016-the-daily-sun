EFF leader Julius Malema has told his supporters to immediately grab unused land.He said the ANC failed to give it back to black people but was prepared to punish those who call for land grabs.Speaking to a large gathering outside the Newcastle Magistrates Court in KZN he said: &ldquo;If it means going to prison for telling you to take the land, so be it.&rdquo;Earlier this year, Malema appeared in court for making the same call. The Hawks brought charges against him for contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act after a speech he made during the 61st Freedom Charter celebrations in Newcastle in June, when he called on Mzansi people to occupy land.His case was postponed to 7 December.Malema explained it was inevitable that the land will be taken from the white minority. &ldquo;We will take back the land by any means necessary. &rsquo;&ldquo;We demand our identity back. Tell everyone you want the land,&rdquo; he said. He said the real criminals like former president FW de Klerk were not in court for stealing land.&ldquo;When the EFF takes over, you will never doubt yourself because you will be the owners of land. The land comes with trees, even dagga.&rdquo;He said EFF was taking the struggle forward. &ldquo;The journey is the defeat of white monopoly capital, the defeat of the Ruperts and Oppenheimers.&rdquo; He said he would challenge the act he was charged with in the High Court because it was unconstitutional.The EFF leader also called for early national elections.&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t remove Zuma, we won&rsquo;t have a country left,&rdquo; he said.Malema ended his address by singing &ldquo;Kiss the boer, kiss the farmer&rdquo;.
