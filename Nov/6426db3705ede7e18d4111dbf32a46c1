ORLANDO PIRATES&rsquo; dribbling wizard, Thabo &ldquo;Jomodinho&rdquo; Rakhale, has come out guns blazing to set the record straight.This following a report about his love life.His move was prompted by the story in last week&rsquo;s Sunday Sun suggesting the soccer star had scored &ldquo;big love&rdquo; with Sbongile &ldquo;Cbowee&rdquo; Memela from Umlazi, Durban, who studies in Pretoria.The student had gone as far as hinting on her Instagram account to having an affair with Thabo.I can never expect perfection because I&rsquo;m far from it, but it&rsquo;s been a long way, can&rsquo;t give up now, Sbongile wrote.As long you&rsquo;re trying, I&rsquo;m staying. In his search for the truth, Thabo dismissed claims that he had contact with Sbongile.&ldquo;I only exchanged text messages with her through Instagram. I&rsquo;ve never visited her at her place, nor has she come to mine,&rdquo; Thabo insisted.He said Sbongile took advantage of his friendliness.&ldquo;There are women who throw themselves at soccer players,&rdquo; Thabo said.&ldquo;By this, they destroy our reputation as role modelsekasi and the brands we&rsquo;re associated with.&ldquo;This woman&rsquo;s actions force those in the public eye to be private and impossible.&rdquo;Sibongile refused to comment and hung up on us.
