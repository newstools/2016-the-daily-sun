WHILE AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo is sitting in jail, a fight is brewing in his kingdom.His son Prince Azenathi cut the chains locking his father&rsquo;s royal home and is readying himself to take a wife and grab the reins. But another faction is ready to announce his uncle, Jongisizwe Mankunku, as king.On Friday, Azenathi obtained an urgent court order allowing him to cut the locks at Bumbane Great Place.He was accompanied by his mum No-College, High Court Judge Buyiswa Majiki, Chief Dumisani Mgudlwa, family members and the court sheriff, who helped to cut the chains.Azenathi said he approached the Mthatha High Court after first asking his stepmum Queen Nokwanda to open the gates, but she refused.The queen declined to comment.King Dalindyebo allegedly gave instructions in January for Bumbane to be locked.Student Azenathi told the SunTeam he was ready to fulfil his father&rsquo;s wishes by becoming acting king. &ldquo;I am opening my father&rsquo;s home to all the AbaThembu.&rdquo;Azenathi&rsquo;s move comes two weeks after one AbaThembu faction chose him as acting leader of the nation.&ldquo;Prince Azenathi will be installed as the acting king of the Abathembu on 25 November,&rdquo; said Mgudlwa.
