ONLINE registrations for pupils at Gauteng schools close today, but gatvol parents say the system is rubbish!Some parents said their kids have not been placed in schools yet, while others claim they applied on time but the schools they chose rejected their kids.&ldquo;We are worried. We don&rsquo;t know where our children will study next year,&rdquo; a parent said.&ldquo;The districts are also not helpful. They haven&rsquo;t done anything to intervene. We receive confirmation that our children have been admitted at certain schools, but when we get there the schools flatly refuse to take them,&rdquo; said one parent.&ldquo;The department came up with this system and yet when we encounter problems, they fold arms and refuse to help us.&rdquo;One parent told Daily Sun she had applied back in April but was still in limbo.Khume Ramulifho of the DA said the system had been problematic since its inception.&ldquo;It only gives parents headaches. Parents of pupils living close to the Overkruin and Montana high schools in Pretoria are unhappy about the MEC not attending to the matter swiftly.&rdquo;The online registrations were initiated by the department of education in April, but the system has been marred by problems and periodic delays.Oupa Bodibe, spokesman for the department, said they were in the process of finalising enrolment processes and that the districts would assist parents with placements where space was still available. &ldquo;Parents who are not happy with the offers of placement provided may object to the district directors by completing an objection form obtainable from the school or district office. It should be noted that pupils will be placed at a school where there is space available. This might not be close to where their parents work or live.&rdquo;
