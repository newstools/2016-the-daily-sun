How often have you longed to do this? A fed-up Harare driver got back to his vehicle, found it clamped and drove off anyway.His tyres screech, the clamp clatters, the smartly-dressed guy gets out of the driver&rsquo;s seat and tries to pull the clamp off, fails and then just drives off anyway, straight onto a busy thoroughfare. A crowd gathers to watch him.The video was posted to YouTube on Tuesday by the state-controlled Zimpapers and looks to have been filmed very near to Herald House in the centre of the capital Harare. The Herald is Zimpapers' flagship daily.Clampers prowl the streets of Zimbabwe's cities and towns looking for illegally parked cars. Like Zimbabwe's traffic police - who seem to devise new offenses they can fine you for daily (heard of the "overfull" fire extinguisher one?) - they are intensely disliked.Watch the video below.&nbsp; http://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/watch-fed-up-harare-driver-defies-wheel-clamp-drives-off-2016110
