ALTHOUGH Bidvest Wits are top of the Absa Premiership table, coach Gavin Hunt reckons their current position doesn&rsquo;t mean they will win the league. The Clever Boys have been on a great run this season and already have one cup title under their belt following their triumph in the recent MTN8 final. Said Hunt: &ldquo;It just means we got some points from the games we played. It doesn&rsquo;t mean anything at this stage. All you can do is get yourself in a good position and capitalise from there.&rdquo;Hunt has bemoaned the number of games they have been playing away from their home ground (Bidvest Stadium) at the Milpark Wits University campus due to the #FeesMustFall campaign. But with riots having calmed as exams continue without any glitches, Hunt hopes they will soon be back at the Bidvest Stadium. &ldquo;The biggest problem for us is that we&rsquo;ve been playing away games. We have played only one home game. I don&rsquo;t know if that is good or bad. &ldquo;We have to keep our heads down and keep working hard,&rdquo; he added. They will be away to Platinum Stars in their next league match at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium on Saturday. &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t understand that home is home. You want to play home, you want to play on your own pitch. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why there are home and away games. We have played only one game at home. It&rsquo;s frustrating but we can&rsquo;t look at that. If it doesn&rsquo;t happen we still have to play and do what we do,&rdquo; he added. Wits players have received a lot of praise for the quality displays they have put on this season, but the former SuperSport United mentor believes the players have to keep proving themselves. He said: &ldquo;If this team does better than last year&rsquo;s team or the year before, then it is a better team. We have not done anything, we have not achieved anything. Yes, we have won a trophy &ndash; a three-game trophy. &ldquo;You know my feelings on the league. We get judged on the league, not on cups.&rdquo;
