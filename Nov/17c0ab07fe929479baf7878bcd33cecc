WHILE other gogos joyfully look forward to a happy festive season, gogo Busisiwe Duma (76) from Groutville in KwaDukuza is in despair.She told Daily Sun about her day-to-day plight of living without her pension grant since April. She said her misery started when the Sassa officials told her that she won&rsquo;t be getting her pension anymore as she was registered as a dead person on 16 March.&ldquo;At my age, the ability to do things on my own slowly fades away. &ldquo;It makes everything in my life painful. Most of my children don&rsquo;t have jobs and they don&rsquo;t stay with me. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really have anyone who helps me financially. I survive by doing a washing job in a neighbouring village in order to buy 10kg of maize meal each month.&rdquo; She said she&rsquo;s been going to KwaDukuza Home Affairs almost every two weeks in an attempt to get her issue resolved but with no luck. &ldquo;Now I don&rsquo;t know what to do because I am running out of taxi fare. The neighbours who&rsquo;ve helped me all along are now fed up.&rdquo; She claimed officials at Home Affairs couldn&rsquo;t explain why she is still registered as dead. Thabo Mokgola, Home Affairs spokesman, advised Busisiwe to go to her nearest cop shop to write out an affidavit to explain that she is still alive. &ldquo;I will pass her enquiry to the KZN Home Affairs provincial manager. He will call her to arrange an appointment for the process of investigation at her nearest Home Affairs office. That&rsquo;s where she will have to produce the affidavit that will be used in the re-application of her life status.&rdquo; KZN Sassa spokesman, Vusi Mahaye, said they will send officials to visit the gogo. &ldquo;If they see that she is really in dire need of our intervention, we will give her food parcels or food vouchers every month until her issue is sorted out.&rdquo;
