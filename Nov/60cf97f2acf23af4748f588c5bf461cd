JAMES Gubeka claims his stokvel money went missing when cops raided his house two weeks ago. Following the incident, he put muthi around his house and he has vowed that anyone who got a share of his R39 000 will not live to see Christmas! The 58-year-old from Rosettenville in Joburg told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I consulted a strong sangoma from Mozambique who has assured me the officers who stole my money will bring it back. If they don&rsquo;t return the money, whoever has a share of it will die.&rdquo; James said he didn&rsquo;t believe he would get justice by opening a case against the cops. &ldquo;If I open a case, it won&rsquo;t go anywhere as the police protect each other. I tried to open a case after it happened with no success.&rdquo; James added he had buried the muthi in his yard and at the main gate of his house. He said the trouble started on the night of 17 November when he heard a neighbour screaming. He went outside to help and fired warning shots into the air. &ldquo;The police came and demanded to know if my firearm was legal. After confirming that it was, they searched my house. They found the stokvel money under a mattress and took it,&rdquo; said James. &ldquo;The stokvel members are now fighting with me because they want their money for Christmas. The officers must just bring back my money or they will face death.&rdquo; Captain Kay Makhubela said James must open a case if his money was taken by cops. &ldquo;Once he has reported it, the case will be investigated. If he doesn&rsquo;t open a case there is nothing we can do,&rdquo; he said.
