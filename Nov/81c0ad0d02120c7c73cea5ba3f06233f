ORLANDO Pirates interim coach Augusto Palacios is hoping to start his tenure on a good note when Bucs host Highlands Park in their Telkom Knockout quarterfinal at Orlando Stadium (8.30pm) tomorrow. The last time Palacios was at the helm of Pirates in 2012, he won the league after taking over from Julio Leal. The Peruvian mentor now replaced Muhsin Ertugral, who stepped down midweek after the Buccaneers&rsquo; humiliating 6-1 Absa Premiership defeat at the hands of SuperSport United.Although he is not promising to lead the current side to the Premiership title, Palacios revealed he would instil discipline in the players: &ldquo;The thing I want, which is most important, is discipline. I will not take nonsense from anyone. There is no way the players will use cellphones at camp, for example. &ldquo;For players to focus on the game they can&rsquo;t have their cellphones. They can use them in their rooms but not during meals, in the bus or in the change-room. I want them to focus when we go to camp.&rdquo;He added that he wanted his players to understand that the club was for professionals. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have military discipline. I will not take away players&rsquo; freedom but they need to understand. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. We will do breathalyser tests every time before training,&rdquo; he added.Players are free to display their talent and skill on the pitch but it should bring positive results. Palacios realises the match against the Lions of the North will not be easy with a coach of Gordon Igesund&rsquo;s calibre leading Highlands. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a tactician. I watched the team when they played against Chippa United in Tembisa. They are playing well. We never underestimate any team,&rdquo; he said.
