THE DA believes this time ANC members will have the courage to vote against President Jacob Zuma.The motion of no confidence against the president will be debated in Parliament today.Mabine Seabe, spokesman for DA leader Mmusi Maimane, told Daily Sun they were lobbying ANC members to put the people of South Africa first.&ldquo;Zuma is not their president only. He is everybody&rsquo;s president. We are lobbying ANC members to vote with their conscience. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s either they vote for the good of the people or they vote for Zuma. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.&rdquo; He said for the ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe to say the motion does not have serious value shows a lack of understanding of Parliament and the law. &ldquo;The president can&rsquo;t be allowed to run amok,&rdquo; he said.Referring to the spy tapes, he said there is evidence that the president should be removed from office. &ldquo;The people of this country deserve better,&rdquo; Seabe said.Today&rsquo;s motion comes after the release of the State Capture report by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela. Cope spokesman Dennis Bloem told Daily Sun they are also calling on ANC members to do the right thing.&ldquo;Zuma is a liability. That&rsquo;s why we want him out. Since the ConCourt judgment, we have stopped recognising him as our president.&rdquo;Bloem said ANC members will think of their jobs because they have bonds, cars to pay and children to take care of.The EFF&rsquo;s Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said they have no say over the vote of ANC members.&ldquo;All we&rsquo;ll be doing is voting to remove Zuma,&rdquo; he told Daily Sun.Moloto Mothapo, spokesman for the ANC Chief Whip said the motion has no serious value because it claims guilt of state capture on the part of the president. &ldquo;Parliament and the nation are dragged into the opposition&rsquo;s petty games of political stunts,&rdquo; he said.
