PAULINAH Mphaphuli is a sad woman. She said she was deceived by a man of God she trusted with her money. The 52-year-old from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun a pastor and his wife took R3 000 from her for a trip around Africa that was supposed to happen in June. However, Paulinah never went. &ldquo;The pastor had been my friend for as long as I can remember. I trusted him with my soul because I thought he and his wife were good people. But what they did to me is unforgivable. I just want my money back,&rdquo; she said. Paulinah said she had saved the money to move her belongings to a new house she had moved into. &ldquo;My life is now on hold because of him. I can&rsquo;t do anything because I don&rsquo;t have money to transport my stuff,&rdquo; she said. The pastor, who is only known as Pastor Makua, said he was aware of Paulinah&rsquo;s allegation. &ldquo;Sister Paulinah and I are good friends and I acknowledge she gave us money, but we never said she was coming with us on the trip.&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why she&rsquo;s running to the newspaper when she has our number. I promised to pay her back, which I have already started doing. &ldquo;I have already given her R700 and I still owe her R2 300, which she will get this weekend. She must just talk to me.&rdquo; Paulinah admitted to receiving money from the pastor but she said the way he was paying her back was unfair. &ldquo;I gave them R3 000 in full and they must return it the same way.&rdquo;
