THERE were rubber bullets and tears at Sunday&rsquo;s evictions in Tembisa&rsquo;s Desmond Park, Ekurhuleni. Over 20 people were injured when residents and Red Ants allegedly got into a fist fight. The squatters have vowed not to move from the land they occupy illegally. They claim the land on which they erected over 100 shacks belongs to no one.A man living at the settlement said he was going nowhere. &ldquo;We will come back here and are not afraid of them. They even brought the Red Ants to attack us so we do not take our shacks. &ldquo;I think they were given clear instructions that they should beat us up.&rdquo;Residents said the squatter camp mushroomed last year. Every month people are evicted but they keep returning.They allege last December a man died during the evictions and Desmond Place was named after him.But Ekurhuleni Metro Police&rsquo;s Lieutenant Kobedi Mokheseng said the land belongs to a private owner known as Strydom and this is why, they together with the police, were part of the operation.&ldquo;The Red Ants and SAPS were accompanied by Metro police. The demolishing of illegal shacks went ahead despite residents resisting. &ldquo;We were there to calm the situation down even though stones were thrown at us. We can confirm no one has been arrested and no casualties were reported at the scene.&rdquo; Red Ants&rsquo; Selby Dunn denied claims that members exchanged blows with residents.He said they were there to do their work and never assaulted anyone. &ldquo;We had a court order for the place to be cleaned. Those people are trespassers. Nobody assaulted anyone but they threw stones at us. We only used our shields to protect ourselves from the rocks with the help of the metro police and SAPS.&rdquo;
