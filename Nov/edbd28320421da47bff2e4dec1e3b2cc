A MEETING to discuss grievances over corruption claims was postponed to Tuesday.On Wednesday, residents of Makana Village in Ndumo, northern KZN barricaded the P435 Road with stones and burning tyres, demanding that they be hired for construction jobs in the area. The residents accused induna Nhlangano Tembe, who heads the local transport committee, of hiring only his friends and relatives when the provincial transport department sends private companies to repair their roads. Yesterday an urgent meeting was called, but later postponed to Tuesday. A new recruitment procedure will be approved at the meeting.Resident Themba Tembe (31) said Nhlangano ignores needy residents.&ldquo;When there are jobs, he is supposed to arrange a community meeting so those who are hired can be recruited transparently. &ldquo;Instead, he chooses workers from a list of people we don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Tembe.Ward Councillor Ben Msweli confirmed the meeting was postponed to next week.&ldquo;Hopefully, a solution will be found. The protest has stopped and calm has been restored.&rdquo; Induna Nhlangano said: &ldquo;If they feel I&rsquo;m no longer doing things correctly, we can find an alternative. &ldquo;The people I hire are on the list we drafted with the community. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t always have time to call a meeting when vacancies come up, so I end up calling people from that list.&rdquo; KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said cops are still monitoring the area.She said: &ldquo;A 22-year-old woman was arrested for public violence and will soon appear at the Ingwavuma Magistrates Court soon.&rdquo;
