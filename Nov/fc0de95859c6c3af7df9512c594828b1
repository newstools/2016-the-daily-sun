IT WAS a stroll in the park for Africa and Absa Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns as they tore Highlands Park apart, winning 5-0 at Loftus Versfeld Stadium yesterday to record their third successive league win.And the star of the show was striker Percy Tau, who scored the opening goal and set up three more in a one-sided first half as Downs strolled to their biggest win of the season so far. It could have been &ndash; and should have been &ndash; a bigger winning margin as Downs took control from the kick-off.The Brazilians, who will represent Africa at next month&rsquo;s Fifa World Club Cup in Japan, were never troubled by third-from-bottom Highlands, whose new coach Gordon Igesund could only shake his head in dismay as Tau robbed Augustine Mbara and slotted home a stunning individual goal after only seven minutes. Liberian Anthony Laffor scored the second five minutes later to add to the Lions of the North&rsquo;s woes.Igesund now realises the job he has taken on, and on this showing Highlands will be fighting a rearguard action this season to avoid going back to the National First Division. The Lions of the North defence was a shambles and that is something Igesund will have to sort out soon.Highlands have not won a game since the opening day of the season when they beat fellow rookies Baroka FC 2-1.Igesund replaced Allan Freese, who guided Highlands to promotion at the end of last season, last month but after a morale-boosting away 2-2 draw against joint leaders Bidvest Wits last week, Highlands struggled in the Tshwane heat yesterday.It was 3-0 and game over in the 35th minute when Sibusiso &ldquo;Villa&rdquo; Vilakazi, who earlier missed a sitter, crashed home a Tau pass and two minutes later Themba Zwane blasted home a Tau cross to make it 4-0.Downs have now scored 12 times in six league matches and looked awesome in the first half.Tau would not be tamed and forced Highlands defender Rudi Isaacs to steer the ball into his own net in the 52nd minute to make it 5-0. After that Downs took their foot off the pedal and cruised to their easy win.
