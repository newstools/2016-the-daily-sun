A FORMER thwasa has claimed that since she ignored her calling and chose to become a faith healer, she has been tormented by demons and tokoloshes. Gogo Hilda Ntlantsana (67) from KwaZekhele in Port Elizabeth told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I became a thwasa in 1994 and I was top of my class. &ldquo;Everyone wanted to make use of my services because the sangoma spirits were strong in me. They said I was sharp like a razor. &ldquo;Other trainees were jealous of me and I was afraid of them. &ldquo;Then in 1997, I abandoned the sangoma route and joined a church. &ldquo;I became a prophet and was making more money. &ldquo;But my neighbours became jealous of me. I moved to Ramaphosa squatter camp and my clients followed me.&rdquo; While Hilda was consulting a client, she saw horrible demons flying towards her. She claimed they looked like big grey rats, red ants and bats. They were with a tokoloshe who had dreadlocks. &ldquo;The bat ate my hair and since then, my life has been miserable.&rdquo; Gogo Hilda said the demons haunted her day and night and her neighbours started accusing her of witchcraft. &ldquo;They stoned my house and I had to move to KwaZakhele,&rdquo; she said. Hilda sold her house in Ramaphosa for R75 000 but she spent R46 000 of that money consulting doctors and sangomas. &ldquo;Instead of being healed, I became more ill. Now I can&rsquo;t even walk.&rdquo; Gogo Hilda&rsquo;s son, Mbulelo (48) said he and his mum couldn&rsquo;t sleep at night because people burned impepho outside and sprinkled the house with holy water. Sangoma Bhayiliyatsholoza Dodi said the gogo needs to make peace with her ancestors and continue with her calling.
