WHEN he realised that chances of him pursuing his studies in carpentry were very slim, he turned to a hobby he started while still a young boy. Khulekani Sibiya (35) from Slenger in Pietermaritzburg, in the KZN Midlands, makes a living by building kennels using wooden planks. The father of two girls aged six and eleven told Daily Sun that he didn&rsquo;t allow his circumstances, or being raised by a single mother in a big family, drive him to do wrong things.&ldquo;I am the eldest of four children. Our mother had a tough time raising us. When I passed my matric I had to accept that I had to find a way to bring in some money.&rdquo; He said he started by helping carpenters put in ceiling boards when they were building houses in the area.&ldquo;Seeing that it wasn&rsquo;t giving me enough money I thought of something that was going to give me more cash. That&rsquo;s when I started building these kennels.&rdquo; He said he made them at home.&ldquo;But last year I moved my work away from my house. I took it to the side of a road leading to the CBD, to gain more customers.&rdquo; He said his decision to move has made a huge financial difference to him and his family.&ldquo;I am now getting more customers compared to when I was working from home.&rdquo; He said his business booms during winter when people want to make sure that their pets are warm in the cold weather.
