ALL the efforts by police to curb crime will be in vain unless the cops are spiritually empowered, said Thohoyandou SAPS head Lieutenant-General Azwihangwisi Mulaudzi.She was speaking at a prayer service organised for police and their families in preparation for the festive season, when the crime rate tends to rise.The occasion was attended by hundreds of officers, some in uniform and others in plain clothes.The service was held at the SAPS Sibasa Mess Hall on Tuesday. Cops and pastors from Thohoyandou and surrounding areas sang and danced before the pastors prayed as part of the Adopt a Station and Cop campaign.Mulaudzi said: &ldquo;The police need divine guidance in order to perform their duties. &ldquo;We felt that we should, in conjunction with our pastors, sit down and dedicate today as a day of prayer. &ldquo;We also felt as police that as the year draws to an end and we approach the festive season, we should come together and revive our members. We must give them more fire to be able to fight the scourge of crime during this period. &ldquo;Criminal acts are caused by demons and we are here to pray that people change their hearts and turn to God.&ldquo;Then this area will be safe for everyone.&rdquo;Mulaudzi said the police will go all out to prevent crime in the whole cluster.She thanked the pastors for their support over the years.On behalf of the pastors, Apostle Fulufhedzani Netshitavhe said they have adopted the police stations and cops in the area to give them support in the difficult task they perform in the community.
