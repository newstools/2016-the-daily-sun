A TAXI war erupted yesterday morning between the Makhado long-distance and Polokwane Sibasa taxi associations.A taxi filled with men arrived at the Indian Centre Taxi Rank in Polokwane, Limpopo, and they started shooting at people randomly. The violence was reportedly linked to conflict over a route to Musina. A taxi belonging to the Polokwane Sibasa Association was already full of passengers and ready to drive to Musina when the gunshots rang out. Three men believed to be from the Makhado association forced passengers out of the taxi before they poured petrol over it and set it alight. Two more taxis were partly burned before firefighters arrived at the scene. A Polokwane Sibasa Association driver was hit on his head with an axe and rushed to hospital, while two other drivers were slightly injured. Amos Maphanga (44), the driver of the burned taxi, said: &ldquo;When I heard the gunshots, I ran into a shop. &ldquo;I saw one man pouring petrol over my taxi and another setting it alight. &ldquo;All of them had guns. If I hadn&rsquo;t run into the shop they would have killed me. Our association has a permit to transport people to Musina. &ldquo;They do not have a permit but also want to use the route.&rdquo; While the taxi was burning, a Toyota Quantum and an Avanza arrived and picked up the suspects. Privilege Musariri (49) was in the taxi when the attack started. &ldquo;I was so frightened, because they had guns,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They burned all our belongings which were in the taxi.&rdquo; Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe of the police confirmed that cases of malicious damage to property and public violence were opened.
