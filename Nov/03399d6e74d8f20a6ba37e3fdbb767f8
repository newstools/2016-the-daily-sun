AWARD-WINNING rapper, Cassper Nyovest, has been crawling below the radar since allegedly losing his flashy wheels.That&rsquo;s because the Mama I Made It hitmaker was allegedly involved in an accident.But Sunday Sun sources close to the rapper were sceptical.They not only questioned the accident story, but weren&rsquo;t sold on his insurance allegedly refusing to pay out.&ldquo;We find that story very dodgy. It would be unlike him not to post if he was involved in an accident,&rdquo; the source told the People&rsquo;s Paper.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to seem like haters, but that Bentley is not there.&ldquo;We support Cassper, but he should tell us the truth about the car and about the accident.&rdquo;Another source said the Bentley&rsquo;s maintenance costs were too much for Cassper.&ldquo;He sold it,&rdquo; the source claimed.&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just have a Bentley unless you are wealthy.&ldquo;He was clearly taking chances,&rdquo; the source said.&ldquo;Cassper sometimes puts himself under unnecessary pressure.&rdquo;The third source was sympathetic towards the rapper. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t owe anyone an explanation,&rdquo; the source said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s his money and his problems. Everyone in life has their ups and downs.&rdquo;Yesterday the SunTeam approached him for a comment, but Cassper didn&rsquo;t want to comment and hung up on us.
