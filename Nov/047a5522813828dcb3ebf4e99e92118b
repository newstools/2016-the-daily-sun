NOBODY thought it was strange when the man gave the kids his lunchbox. After all, they knew him and he had done it before.But this time the lunchbox was allegedly packed with killer food and it claimed four-year-old Ofentse Mdebele&rsquo;s life.The boy&rsquo;s dad, David Mdebele (40) from OR Tambo squatter camp in Randfontein, Gauteng said the lunchbox contained bread and fried eggs.&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t suspect anything because we know the man,&rdquo; he said.Ofentse&rsquo;s aunt, Margret Mosadi (31) said Ofentse was playing with four other kids on Sunday when the man called the boys and gave them the food. &ldquo;The boy who was given the box placed it on the kitchen table and went back to play because he had just eaten,&rdquo; said Margret.The kids who ate the food soon started vomiting.&ldquo;Ofentse was weak and vomiting badly. We tried to cool him down with a wet cloth on his forehead while waiting for an ambulance,&rdquo; said Margret.But the boy was declared dead at the scene by paramedics. &ldquo;I went with the other kids to Leratong Hospital where they were treated and discharged.&rdquo; Margret said the man had not been to their house for three months.David alleged the man told him the lunchbox was prepared on Friday.&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s true it means the food had spoiled,&rdquo; said David. But why didn&rsquo;t he throw it away?&rdquo; Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said an inquest docket has been opened. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s proven the kids were deliberately poisoned, the man will be arrested.&rdquo;
