Outside, angry residents protested that they should not be granted bail.The magistrate released the 17-year-old into the custody of his parents as he is a minor, while his siblings were kept in custody until 18 February, when they&rsquo;ll apply for bail.Police Captain Phillip Fakude said two men had been on the run from the police since the incident occurred in Lillydale last Sunday. They have since handed themselves over to the police. In a video that has gone viral on social media, the siblings are seen viciously attacking half-naked Sharon (30) with sjamboks. She is also bashed with fists and kicked. &ldquo;I will never forgive them,&rdquo; said humiliated Sharon. &ldquo;I want them to rot in jail. They attacked me for having rescued a young woman at a tavern. They forced her to dance for them because she was wearing a short skirt.&rdquo;Sharon said the siblings have been stalking her ever since and calling her names. They finally caught up with her when she went to have her hair done at a salon.Angry village leader Constance Khoza condemned the incident.
