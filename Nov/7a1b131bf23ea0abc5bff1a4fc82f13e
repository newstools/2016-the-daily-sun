When we report them, the company doesn’t take our complaints seriously. I’m one of the victims of an area manager. “He had been sexually harassing me with SMSes, and I opened a case against him in January. Instead of taking action against him, I was advised to ignore him.”Mbuyiseli Rwaxa, a leader of the Ibhunga community, said the protesting guards called them for assistance. Eastern Cape Health spokesman Siyanda Manana said the matter was between Mafoko Security and its employees. “Their internal problems are affecting us negatively. They came with leaders from Ibhongo but we told them we’re not to blame and they should consult Mafoko.”Daily Sun tried to get comment from Mafoko Security but a woman who identified herself as Didi said she couldn’t comment and said her boss wasn’t available.
