MAMELODI Sundowns Ladies striker, Andisiwe Mgcoyi, has promised to make a meaningful impact for Banyana Banyana at the upcoming Africa Women&rsquo;s Cup of Nations. Mgcoyi was named in coach Desiree Ellis&rsquo; final squad for the tournament in Cameroon from 19 November to 3 December. South Africa are in Group A with hosts, Zimbabwe and Egypt. Group B consists of reigning champions Nigeria, Ghana, Mali and Kenya. The shock exclusion from Ellis&rsquo; squad was Sanah Mollo, who scored three goals in the qualifiers against Botswana. Right-back Lebogang Ramalepe has also been left out, while Amanda Dlamini dropped out due to prior commitments. Leandra Smeda makes her return.Said Ellis: &ldquo;We know there had been a problem with scoring but we scored three times against Egypt, which is a good start. We want to play more attacking football. We want to allow our creative players to be able to use that creativity to do damage.&rdquo;Before Banyana depart for Cameroon for the tournament on Monday, they will face Zimbabwe in a friendly in Harare tomorrow.Lanky striker Mgcoyi didn&rsquo;t see any action under former Dutch coach Vera Pauw. Although she also played against the Pharaohs last month, she said she would be looking better now, as she has fully recovered from her hamstring injury. Said Mgcoyi: &ldquo;I am glad I already got a chance to play. &ldquo;I played with an injury and don&rsquo;t think I was able to give it my best, but now that I have fully recovered, I will do better.&rdquo;The goal poacher has promised to contribute to ensure Bayana fare better than they did at the last women&rsquo;s Afcon, where they finished fourth, failing to land a spot at the Fifa Women&rsquo;s World Cup. &ldquo;Nothing can stop us. I believe in this team,&rdquo; Mgcoyi said.
