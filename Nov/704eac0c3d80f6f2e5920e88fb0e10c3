WHEN three men thought of robbing the Pick n Pay in Soshanguve they had the perfect plan.On Monday they went inside the shop armed with guns, ordered the G4S security guard to give them the money he had just collected, and fled.Their black Audi A4 getaway car was waiting for them.But what they didn&rsquo;t know was that another guard from the same company realised what had just happened.He was travelling in a different cash-in-transit vehicle and, as the thugs drove past him, he gave chase.At the four-way stop the guard crashed into their car.The thugs&rsquo; car hit another vehicle and as it ground to a halt they fled.They then hijacked another car and got away, leaving their loot behind.Soshanguve police spokesman Captain Stephens Maluleka said that when the police arrived at the scene the thugs were gone.He praised the G4S guard for his bravery. &ldquo;He could easily have become a victim too, but never thought of himself but only of doing the right thing,&rdquo; he said.Maluleka added that the thugs are still on the loose and that police investigations are ongoing.According to him, the car into which the thugs crashed belonged to a couple who was rushed to a local hospital.&ldquo;They were not injured but seemed extremely shaken about what had happened.&ldquo;We took them to hospital to be treated for shock,&rdquo; he said.He added that after opening the case, the driver of the Toyota VVTi bakkie the men had fled in was also taken to hospital.&ldquo;We appeal to anyone with information to come forward or to call 08600 10111,&rdquo; said Maluleka.
