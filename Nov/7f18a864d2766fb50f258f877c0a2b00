IT&rsquo;S that time of the year when crime increases!But Makuya Police Station outside Thohoyandou has a plan. It has recruited 40 volunteers from villages around the Thohoyandou area who will be operating as community policing forum members to fight crime.Captain Tsumembedzo Nemungadi said: &ldquo;We want to be crime-free in our communities this festive season because our team, youths and women against crime will be in full force. &ldquo;We understand domestic violence is a major crime, but if communities join with police, we can end it.&rdquo; Nemungadi was joined during recruitment by the crime prevention police team and pastors to launch the joint venture for the festive season.Warrant Officer Mmberegeni Mudau said they were excited that a Good Samaritan resident has donated reflectors for the volunteer youth, women against crime and community policing forum members. He said the donation will help them be visible. &ldquo;We will hold door-to-door campaigns, road blocks and also hand over pamphlets.&rdquo; He said his team would also patrol villages and inform residents about the neighbourhood watch and advise them to stop walking alone at night.Mmbi Munasi ,who donated the reflectors, said crime doesn&rsquo;t pay.
