A VICIOUS fire destroyed 20 shacks and took a life in White City, Mbekweni, near Paarl, on Friday morning. It is suspected that the fire started in the home of Bulelani Tyambetyu (20), where he was sleeping alone. He was later found dead in his burnt bed. Thirty-eight people were displaced and most lost all their belongings. Zingisa Soka (19) lost her school books in the fire and only managed to take a pen with her as she ran out of her family&rsquo;s burning house. She was supposed to write maths on Friday, but because of the fire she did not go to school. She reported the issue and was told she could write the paper yesterday.&nbsp; &ldquo;We lost our money in the fire. I&rsquo;m going to struggle to pay for transport to school,&rdquo; said Zingisa, who wants to be a social worker one day. Linda Dimande, who lived next door to Bulelani, said: &ldquo;We woke up at about 2am when we heard people shouting there was a fire. The flames where so big at my door that I had to hit my wall at the back very hard to make an opening to get out.&rdquo; Bulelani&rsquo;s father, Nathi Kelem, said he was heartbroken to lose his son as they were only recently re-united. Nathi was at work when the fire started. &ldquo;Bulelani has not lived with me for 15 years. He has only been here for about four months, and now this happens. We used a paraffin lamp in the shack and I suspect that is how the fire started.&rdquo; Councillor Zukiswa Nomana said: &ldquo;I called the fire department. They put out the fire and gave blankets and food parcels to the victims. &ldquo;The municipality gave zinc and poles so that people can build shacks again.&rdquo; Police spokesman Sergeant Nceba Vanqa said: &ldquo;A man burnt to death in Mbekweni on Friday morning and 20 shacks were destroyed. It is suspected that the fire started in the man&rsquo;s shack. An inquest docket was registered.&rdquo;&nbsp;
