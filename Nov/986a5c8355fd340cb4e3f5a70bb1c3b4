THE past few months have been difficult for the residents of Phelandaba in Umhlabuyalingana, northern KZN due to an increasing number of deadly accidents on the R22.Three accidents took place last month when eight lives were lost. Residents fear the worst can happen as the festive season is just around the corner.It is for that reason that Umhlabuyalingana Municipality organised a prayer session near the road at Phelandaba Village on Friday.Municipal spokesman Lindokuhle Motha said the mayor, Nkululeko Mthethwa, saw the need to seek divine intervention as it is known that the festive season usually comes with a lot of carnage on the roads.&ldquo;We were basically praying for safety on the road. We have a religious leaders&rsquo; structure within the municipality so they assisted us a lot in organising the prayer event. We spotted an open field near the road and erected a tent. People came out in large numbers to be part of the event.&rdquo; He added that before the prayer, staff from the local road safety structures and cops conducted a roadblock to ensure the roadworthiness of the cars and to check whether drivers were sober. &ldquo;We also launched our festive season road safety plan. Our traffic officers and employees in the fire department will not be taking any leave until the festive season is over. We are going to work with provincial traffic officers to ensure that roadblocks are conducted regularly in the area,&rdquo; he said.Resident Vuyani Msweli (38) told Daily Sun that he was hoping that the prayers will make a difference.&ldquo;We have seen a number of tragic accidents happening on the R22 road over the past few years. &ldquo;People claim there are ghosts wandering at night there that disrupt drivers. But we often see the families of the dead coming to perform rituals to remove their relative&rsquo;s spirits.&rdquo;
