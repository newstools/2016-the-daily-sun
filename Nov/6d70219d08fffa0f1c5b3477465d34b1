WHEN two soccer coaches at the Vaal Elite Soccer Academy saw the need for soccer equipment, they took to Twitter and engaged with the department of sport, arts, culture and recreation.Following their request, MEC Faith Mazibuko gave them a full soccer kit last week.The club is based at Vereeniging in the Vaal. It provides a soccer development programme for young gifted football players between the ages of six and 19.It targets boys and girls from under-privileged communities in and around Sedibeng.Mazibuko said her department will help the academy with kits and other sporting equipment so that they can make a difference in their community.&ldquo;We have noticed that this academy does not have a sponsor and the coaches want to see children staying far away from drugs.&ldquo;We have partnered with them because we want to improve the lives of young people and encourage them to participate in sport.&rdquo; The academy also accommodates children from various orphanages who come for soccer practices on weekends.Emmanuel Chitengu (36), the academy&rsquo;s marketing manager, said the 10-month development programme is based at Phoenix High School and runs from February to November.&ldquo;The project aims to develop talented soccer players and groom them to become future stars.&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t have the money to buy jerseys and other equipment so we are delighted to have received these kits and equipment.&rdquo;
