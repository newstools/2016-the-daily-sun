After I had fed them and played with them I felt tired. &ldquo;I took a nap under the tree. When I woke up the boy was missing. &ldquo;I asked his older sister but she did not know where he went. I became worried and scared. I began looking for him everywhere but I couldn&rsquo;t find him.&ldquo;I raised an alarm and the residents launched a search. We looked everywhere but with no success. &ldquo;On Monday, community members found my grandson dead in the bush. &ldquo;I am devastated. I feel guilty about his death. &ldquo;If only I hadn&rsquo;t gone to sleep and continued playing with them he would still be alive,&rdquo; she said. Sethu&rsquo;s mum, Thembekile Mpini (32), couldn&rsquo;t hold back her tears as she told the People&rsquo;s Paper that she hoped the people who did this to her son would rot in jail. &ldquo;How can people be so heartless? They kidnapped my little boy and murdered him,&rdquo; she said. Lieutenant Mzwandile Nyambi said an inquest docket was opened and that police were still investigating. &ldquo;The post mortem will determine the cause of the child&rsquo;s death. The charge might thereafter be changed to murder.&rdquo;
