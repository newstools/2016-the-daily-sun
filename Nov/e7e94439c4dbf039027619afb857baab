BANYANA Banyana are hoping to open their Africa Women&rsquo;s Cup of Nations campaign on a high note with another victory over Zimbabwe in the second Group A match tomorrow at the Stade Ahmadou Ahidjo (7pm SA time).Although Banyana had the upper hand over the Mighty Warriors in their last encounter, they should not expect an easy start to the competition. Banyana&rsquo;s refreshed technical bench, led by interim coach Desiree Ellis with the assistance of Maud Khumalo, are capable of continuing from the 3-0 defeat they handed Zimbabwe last week. Using two strikers instead of one will be important in increasing the number of goal scoring chances.The strategy yielded positive results when they beat Egypt 3-1 in a friendly at Dobsonville Stadium last month. Banayna still have to play against hosts Cameroon as well as Egypt, who are also in Group A. Group B consists of Ghana, Mali, Kenya and defending champions Nigeria. The tournament runs from tomorrow to 3 December. Banyana defender Nothando Vilakazi agrees that goals will win them matches: &ldquo;We have to score more goals. That was our downfall last time around. We used to play with a single striker but coach Des has introduced a second striker. I think it works. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d really like us to win the tournament. We&rsquo;ve been second best too often. It&rsquo;s time we stake our claim!&rdquo;
