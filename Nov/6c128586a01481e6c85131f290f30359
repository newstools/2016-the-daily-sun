Orlando Pirates caretaker coach Augusto Palacios is expecting a stern test from Gordon Igesund's Highlands Park in Saturday evening's Telkom Knockout quarter-final clash.In what will be his first match in charge of Bucs following the shock departure of Muhsin Ertugral this week, Palacios will be aiming to record a win and book their place in the semi-finals of the cup competition.However, Palacios admits "it won't be easy" due to opposite number Gordon Igesund's wealth of experience in South Africa's top flight."Obviously we are going into the game with one intention and that is to win the game and progress in the competition," Palacios told reporters."But It won't be easy as I know Gordon. He is a great coach. I have seen the two games against Chippa United which they won and the draw against Free State Stars. &nbsp;"They are playing great football and we have to close them down for us to win this game which is what we want to do."Under the guidance of Ertugral, Pirates recorded a 2-1 victory over Golden Arrows in the previous round, with goals from Mpho Makola and Luvuyo Memela sealing a place in the last eight.
