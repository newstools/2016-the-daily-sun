THERE was chaos during a by-election in KwaMashu, north of Durban, yesterday. About 300 residents refused to take part in the election for a new councillor after being told at the last minute that the voting venue had changed. Residents believed they were going to vote at Enkanyisweni Hall in F section, but when they arrived they were told to go to Bhekuzulu Hall in A section.&ldquo;We decided not to go there because we were not told why the venue had changed. The councillor was supposed to tell us in advance that there had been a change of plan,&rdquo; said one resident. Another resident said: &ldquo;We never wanted our councillor in the first place. Just when we start working with her, she makes things even harder.&rdquo; Although a number of residents refused to vote, the election continued at Bhekuzulu Hall. Councillor Lindiwe Ncayiyana said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the municipality&rsquo;s job to prepare for the elections. My job is to pass on the message to community leaders. They are the ones who should make sure the information reaches residents.&rdquo; She said the venue was changed because there was fighting in Enkanyisweni last Sunday. She said the change was announced at the beginning of last week in the municipality&rsquo;s free newspaper. However, residents said she should have made a public announcement because not everyone reads the newspaper. Municipal spokeswoman Tozi Mthethwa said the matter was reported to the speaker.
