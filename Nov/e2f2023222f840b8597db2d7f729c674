DONKEYS are peaceful if not lazy creatures. But in Pienaarspoort Village, north of Tshwane residents live in fear of one such long-eared beast. Ever since shocked villagers watched as it attacked a flock of sheep and killed an innocent lamb, they believe Satan himself sent it! Steven Moyfo (27) said he was now looking for supernatural intervention to save his livestock as four of his sheep had died and two more were injured! &ldquo;This donkey has gone on a killing rampage. It only targets sheep and leaves other livestock unharmed,&rdquo; said Steven. He said what scared villagers even more was that whenever they chased the donkey, it would vanish without a trace. &ldquo;We can only hear it moaning, but no one can see where it is,&rdquo; Steven said.&nbsp; He added that his livestock were grazing happily when the donkey suddenly approached.&nbsp; &ldquo;My sheep were grazing not far from the house then we saw a huge male donkey walking towards them. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t pay much attention since we know donkeys are harmless animals.&nbsp; &ldquo;But then, all of the sudden, it attacked and grabbed a lamb by its neck, running around with it as we tried to save the lamb, but the donkey was too fast.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said they circulated a video and photos of the donkey, trying to trace the owner, but no one has come forward to claim it.&nbsp; &ldquo;People in the village say they will now go to a sangoma collectively as the mysterious donkey has instilled fear and terror in the village,&rdquo; he said. Kabelo Mabula (19) said the donkey was acting as if it was possessed by some kind of demon.&nbsp; &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t stop it. The funny thing is no one knows who it belongs to. Something needs to be done to stop this. We need someone to help us chase this donkey away with muthi.&rdquo;&nbsp; Korky Levanon, manager at Tshwane SPCA, said: &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t heard of such a report and without any details, we are unable to comment on this.&rdquo;
