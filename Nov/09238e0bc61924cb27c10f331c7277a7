HE TAKES 32 tablets a day for HIV and tuberculosis.But instead of his viral load going down, it keeps going up.The 43-year-old man from Hammarsdale, west of Durban, says he knows why his condition is not improving.&ldquo;I only have three teeth and I can&rsquo;t chew solid food,&rdquo; he said. He said his teeth have been falling out of his mouth since he was diagnosed with HIV in 2003.The unemployed man claims doctors at King Dinuzulu Hospital blame him for his deteriorating state of health.&ldquo;I take my medication according to their schedule. But the doctors think I sleep around instead of taking my pills,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told doctors I need false teeth to eat healthy food, but they keep ignoring me.&rdquo; He said he has contracted TB seven times.&ldquo;Last August, doctors told me I now have mild drug resistant tuberculosis.&rdquo;He added that his ears and eyes don&rsquo;t work properly anymore.&ldquo;I really need new teeth so I can eat fresh food to boost my immune system. &ldquo;At the moment, I can only drink Inkomazi and Mageu. But that&rsquo;s like taking your medication on an empty stomach.&rdquo; KZN Health spokesman Sam Mkhwanazi said: &ldquo;A patient&rsquo;s clinical information is confidential. &ldquo;The department does not discuss such information with other parties, unless it is authorised by the law to do so. The department has been informed the management of the hospital that a certain patient will be assessed. &ldquo;This will help determine the type of medical assistance he needs.&rdquo;
