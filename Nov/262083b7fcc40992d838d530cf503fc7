THE cops were busy doing a routine check-up when they heard sheep bleating from under a bakkie&rsquo;s sail at about 6am on Friday. That&rsquo;s when 11 sheep were found. The three men in the bakkie could not prove that they had bought the livestock. Police spokesman Sergeant Mmako Mophiring said: &ldquo;Members of the Harrismith highway patrol stopped a bakkie on the R712. &ldquo;As the cops approached the bakkie they heard sheep bleating. &ldquo;When they opened the cover they found 11 sheep tied up with rope. The three suspects could not give a good explanation and were arrested for possession of suspected stolen property.&rdquo; At the police station the stock theft unit was informed of the arrests. It was confirmed that the sheep were stolen in Frankfort. The suspects were allegedly taking the sheep to QwaQwa. &ldquo;The value of the stolen sheep is about R16 500. The three suspects will appear in court soon.&rdquo;
