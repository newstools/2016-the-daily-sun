THANDAZILE Dube thought it was just an innocent visit when a relative from Joburg arrived at her house in Mzinyathi, north of Durban.But after a week, the 50-year-old realised that the woman had other motives when she suddenly disappeared and left her three-year-old son behind!Unemployed Thandazile is now urging the provincial department of social development to take the abandoned child to a place of safety as she cannot provide for his needs.&ldquo;He has no food and clothes. And I only earn money by selling herbs,&rdquo; she said.Thandazile said her relative arrived with her son unannounced last month.&ldquo;One morning, after spending a week, she went to an outside toilet.&ldquo;We later found out that she had vanished. Her cellphone rang unanswered. The following day, we called her boyfriend who told us she was with him in Joburg.&rdquo; Thandazile said the boyfriend wasn&rsquo;t the father of the baby. &ldquo;She broke up with her baby daddy who lives in Nongoma last year. I&rsquo;ve tried to contact him but he hung up on me and stopped taking my calls. &ldquo;My attempts to get the baby to a place of safety have failed twice because social workers at the Amathatha offices said local places of safety were full.&rdquo; Attempts by Daily Sun to contact both the baby&rsquo;s parents were unsuccessful as their cellphones went straight to voicemail.Social development spokesman Vukani Mbhele said Thandazile should return to the social workers&rsquo; office and report to the supervisor to get help.&ldquo;Abandoned children are definitely taken and accommodated at our places of safety, but social workers first need to do assessments and verify the information provided by those bringing the children.&rdquo;
