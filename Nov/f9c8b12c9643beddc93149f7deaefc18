WHEN Reginah Ramonyai found a nice man from Malawi to marry, she thought her life would improve. However, her husband disappeared shortly after they got married at Home Affairs! Now she&rsquo;s struggling to get IDs for her kids as officials at Home Affairs have told her she needs to bring her husband with her!The 48-year-old from Ga-Shiloane Village in Limpopo told Daily Sun she married the man in 1998 and it was the biggest regret of her life. &ldquo;After he disappeared that same year, I went to Mankweng Home Affairs to register my children so I could get social grants but I was told to bring him with me,&rdquo; said Reginah. She said Home Affairs officials told her the problem was that her surname was Nkomande on the system while her kids had her mum&rsquo;s surname, Makokga. &ldquo;They say I must change my foreign surname for my children to be assisted. Why can&rsquo;t they just help me?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so stressed. I regret what I did.&ldquo;I need Home Affairs to help me,&rdquo; she said. Mankweng Home Affairs spokeswoman Monnet Dapa said she was not aware of the problem. &ldquo;Reginah must come to our offices so we can do a thorough investigation and see if she can be assisted.&ldquo;Her case sounds as if it needs special attention,&rdquo; she said.
