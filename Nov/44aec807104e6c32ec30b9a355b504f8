&ldquo;MY SISTER&rsquo;S love of men led to her death.&rdquo; These were the words of Ngesiwe Kopele, whose sister was mysteriously killed last Saturday. The 38-year-old told Daily Sun that her sister, Dineo (30) was found in the middle of the street in Hillbrow, Joburg, with multiple stab wounds and the skin pulled off her face. Grieving Ngesiwe said: &ldquo;It breaks my heart that my sister had to die like a dog.&ldquo;She was a person who loved men and lived a very hectic life but no one deserves this. She moved out of the family home a long time ago but she would often visit us with different boyfriends. All we knew was that she lived somewhere in town.&rdquo; Ngesiwe said the police phoned her after finding her number on Dineo&rsquo;s phone, which was found with her body. The family then went to identify her. &ldquo;It was clear that she was murdered. Her face looked like she had been dragged behind a car.&rdquo; &ldquo;We suspect one of her boyfriends was responsible but the police just tell us they don&rsquo;t have enough evidence to make an arrest. What hurts my family is that the person responsible for her death won&rsquo;t be dealt with and we won&rsquo;t get justice.&rdquo;Lieutenant Kay Makhubela said a murder case was being investigated. He said if the family was unhappy with how the case was being handled they should approach the commander at the station.
