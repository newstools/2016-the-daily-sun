SINGER and songwriter Dimakatso &ldquo;Dindy&rdquo; Mashiane is a heartbroken woman.Her friends in the music industry claimed she made DJ Fortee&rsquo;s music career what it is today, but in return he&rsquo;s treating her like dirt.According to sources, DJ Fortee, real name Katlego Tigele, has been short-changing Dindy.One source told Sunday Sun: &ldquo;Dindy was looking for a way forward when she was introduced to DJ Fortee.&ldquo;She did the vocals on his hit song Naughty Dance, which got the music industry to take note of him.&ldquo;It was disturbing to learn that Fortee charged R12 000 and used to give Dindy only R2 000. Exploitation in the music industry is really bad.&rdquo;Another source said they blamed the way the music industry contracts are structured.Said the second source: &ldquo;Only the publisher, DJ and producer benefit from such collaborations. Vocalists are always treated like dirt in terms of royalties and performance cuts.&ldquo;This needs to stop as we&rsquo;re all trying to survive in this cut-throat industry.&rdquo;Dindy, who has some mean vocal abilities, is believed to be a Christian and is apparently not signed under any record or management label.A source close to both Dindy and DJ Fortee told Sunday Sun: &ldquo;She should be getting money. This also creates a gap for opportunists who are dealing with her directly to scam her.&rdquo;Her latest collaboration is with DJ Veneigrette and is titled Believe.Dindy said: &ldquo;I get my own bookings and he gets his separately. If we end up performing at the same place it&rsquo;s just coincidence. I no longer work with him.&rdquo;DJ Fortee said: &ldquo;I get bookings as a DJ and I featured her in one of my most popular songs. &ldquo;If I get bookings, I negotiate an extra fee which can&rsquo;t be same as mine or even half. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually helping her as I make her part of my booking package at an extra cost for the organisers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to explain this to her, but she doesn&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
