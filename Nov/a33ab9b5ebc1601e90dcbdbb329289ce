PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma has survived a gruelling attack on his leadership from within the ANC NEC. The &ldquo;surprise&rdquo; motion by Tourism minister Derek Hannekom for Zuma to step down or be recalled was defeated. There was no voting, but more people on Monday spoke for and against the motion. Insiders say Zuma&rsquo;&rsquo;s defenders had regrouped, and dominated the speaker&rsquo;s list. This was perhaps Zuma&rsquo;s toughest political battle since Polokwane in 2007. He faced a revolt by members of his cabinet including Hannekom, Thulas Nxesi and Aaron Motswaledi.Deputy minister Joe Paahla also supported Hannekom&rsquo;s motion as well as some senior SACP members.However Zuma's cabinet is divided with other minister including Maite Nkoana Mashabane, David Mahlobo and Senzeni Zokwana defending him.A Zuma defender told News 24 that it was gruelling but they had managed to regroup following a poor showing on Saturday. President Zuma is said to have addressed the NEC following a long list of speakers, with many people wanting their position to be known.The party is due to hold a press conference tomorrow afternoon at its headquarters.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/zuma-survives-three-days-of-gruelling-attack-from-within-20161128
