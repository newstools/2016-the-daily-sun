ARCHIBITE Mbatha (69) is a father-in-law with a great heart!The man recently took it upon himself to bury his son-in-law. It all started years ago when Emmanuel Mango (38) made Sibongile Mbatha (32), Archibite&rsquo;s daughter pregnant. According to Archibite, the man promised to marry Sibongile when the time was right. It took two years before Emmanuel was able to pay some of the lobola. He promised to come back and to ask Sibongile for marriage, but that was not to happen.But tragedy struck when Sibongile died. Archibite said: &ldquo;Emmanuel did not neglect his responsibilities despite Sibongile&rsquo;s death. &ldquo;He continued to take care of their daughter. He was a very good man. That is why I did what I had to do.&rdquo; Emmanuel died at Langaville in Tsakane, Ekurhuleni on Wednesday 2 November.Archibite organised the burial and the funeral was held at his place six days later. &ldquo;We could not find his family so we decided to bury him as we had known him for a long time.&rdquo; Archibite said they are looking for Emmanuel&rsquo;s family so they can show them where they buried him.
