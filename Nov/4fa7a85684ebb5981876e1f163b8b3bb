DEPUTY transport minister Sindisiwe Chikunga believes that Thursday&rsquo;s motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma was merely influenced by hatred.She spoke to about 200 members of the Bushbuckridge Pensioners Association at the Word of Hope Christian Centre Church in Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga on Friday.She said Zuma stood up to protect people from the deadly HIV. &ldquo;After seeing kids orphaned and parents killed by HIV/Aids, Zuma did something about it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Some of the kids couldn&rsquo;t even swallow food after contracting this killer disease.&rdquo; The minister went on to hand over blankets to the gogos. She said the blankets come from the Siyahlola Presidential Monitoring Programme.&ldquo;I promised you last year that I would come back with your presents. &ldquo;The ANC government loves you very much,&rdquo; she said.
