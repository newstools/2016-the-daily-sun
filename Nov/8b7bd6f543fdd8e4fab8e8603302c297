PETER Mahlangu says he is traumatised by a tokoloshe.Every night sleeping is a struggle for this 28-year-old from Vusimuzi squatter camp in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni.He claims a naughty tokoloshe plays with his bedroom curtains and makes funny noises.&ldquo;Since last year I&rsquo;ve never had a good night&rsquo;s sleep and it is all because of this creature. I don&rsquo;t even know where it comes from or what it wants from me.&ldquo;I just need help to get rid of it.&rdquo; Peter said it all began when he noticed that his curtains were always open in the morning even though he closed them when he went to bed.He said he got up one night to see what was happening and got the shock of his life.&ldquo;That night I wanted to see what was happening. It was about 1 am when this creature eventually popped up from behind my bedroom curtain.&ldquo;It was as if it had been peeping at me, trying to hide as it made crackling noises.&ldquo;Since then the thing has been coming every night.&rdquo; Peter said he has never visited a sangoma or a traditional healer about the tokoloshe.&ldquo;I always pray every night but I don&rsquo;t see any difference as this thing keeps coming to my room every night.&rdquo;Traditional healer Mahlinza Dlamini advised Peter to do something about the tokoloshe before it becomes a serious problem.
