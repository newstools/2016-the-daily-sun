KENYAN President Uhuru Kenyatta has said that he was "tempted" to refer the US to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for post-elections violence following the recent election of Donald Trump. Thousands of protesters around the US took to the streets soon after the polls early this month, to condemn the election of Trump as president.The protests were mostly peaceful, however. In a video posted on Twitter, the giggling Kenyan leader said that he was "tempted" to take the US to the ICC for "post-election violence", sending his audience into laughter. Social media users reacted to his remarks, with some saying that the court was now "a joke".Others, however, did not find Kenyatta's utterance funny, with some even blasting what they termed his "insensitivity" towards people who have lost loved ones due to political violence.In a case that was reportedly riddled with political interference, Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto were acquitted on charges over post-election violence in 2007 in which more than 1 000 people were killed.Kenyatta&rsquo;s alleged crimes against humanity were dropped on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to take him to trial.Ruto had been charged alongside broadcaster Joshua Sang with murder, deportation and persecution for their alleged leading roles in the violence.At least three African countries, South Africa, Burundi and the Gambia have given notice of their intention to quit the Hague-based court. http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/watch-i-was-tempted-to-refer-us-to-icc-after-trump-win-says-kenyan-leader-20161122
