RESIDENTS of the notorious Glebelands hostel in Umlazi, south of Durban fear that stability at the hostel might be in a shambles &ndash; again.Tension is in the air after a peace committee member was gunned down on Monday near Umlazi Magistrates Court, in what was believed to be revenge for the murder of other hostel members.The victim (46), whose name is withheld until his family have been informed, is said to have been living in block 52.It is alleged the hitmen were travelling in a white bakkie.An independent community activist for human rights and social justice, Vanessa Burger, said the shooting was directly or indirectly linked to the war of vengeance.&ldquo;The deceased was a brave man who sacrificed a lot of his personal life and chose to work with the cops for the sake of residents&rsquo; safety,&rdquo; she said.Burger said the dead man was arrested in August and charged with the murder of hostel warlords who had been killed last year.&ldquo;He was later released when the evidence he gave proved he could not have committed that crime,&rdquo; said Burger. &ldquo;He confessed, however, to having done some dirty work for the warlords and he vowed to help the cops with information.&rdquo; It has also been reported that attempts were made in September on the lives of two other hostel residents.The killings associated with a fight over room allocations and political issues began in March 2014.A total of 65 people have lost their lives since then.KZN safety MEC Mxolisi Kaunda said it was disappointing that incidents of killing continued to &ldquo;spit on the hard work&rdquo; that government had done to stabilise the situation at the hostel.&ldquo;I call on the police to ensure that perpetrators of violence are brought to book swiftly. The cops should also increase their visibility around the hostel,&rdquo; he said.KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of murder was opened at Umlazi Police Station.&ldquo;No arrests have been made,&rdquo; Gwala told Daily Sun.
