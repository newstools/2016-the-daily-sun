ORLANDO Pirates interim coach Augusto Palacios has promised to instil a culture of respect and discipline in his players. He started by banning cellphones and late comers.The strict mentor said he hadn&rsquo;t expected the call from club chairman Irvin Khoza to ask him to take care of the team while they search for Muhsin Ertugral&rsquo;s replacement.It is Palacios's third spell with Bucs as caretaker following Ertugral's resignation on Tuesday. The Peruvian is also not going to make his training sessions open to people.Palacios said: &ldquo;What is important is the discipline. I will not take nonsense from anyone."&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t arrive on time then the change room will be closed and you cannot change, you have to go back home."There is no way players will take cellphones to the camp. Why do you take cellphones to the camp? If you receive bad news on the phone then you cannot play. Now to avoid these things I need the players to focus on the game. Players can use their phones in their rooms but not during meals, not in the bus and not in the change room.&ldquo;I also don&rsquo;t carry a cellphone in the bus, I don&rsquo;t carry a cellphone in the change room and for me discipline starts when the players arrive early.&ldquo;I want the players to understand that Orlando Pirates pays their salaries as full-time professionals and they need to be on time for any activity. I don&rsquo;t want military discipline, I will not stop the freedom of the players, but people need to understand simple aspects of discipline, " Palacios said.
