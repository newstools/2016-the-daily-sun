OVER 1 000 students from the Umfolozi TVET College in Eshowe, in northern KZN, abandoned their exams on Wednesday because of electricity problems on campus and in their residences.The students demanded that college management postpone their final exams because they had not prepared well. They had been without electricity since Saturday. The students told Daily Sun that they had been using candlelight to study.They feared this might have a negative impact on their exam results as they&rsquo;ve been unable to access the internet at college or use their cellphones.A student said: &ldquo;The situation is really bad and it seems that the problem is not going to be solved soon. The college is not even giving us proper updates.&rdquo; Another student said they had to throw away food in their fridges because it had gone rotten in the heat.The exams continued as the college said it didn&rsquo;t have the power to postpone them.Bhekani Ndlovu, the college spokesman, confirmed that Eshowe campus has been without electricity since a terrible thunderstorm struck on Saturday. He said they had called technicians to fix the problem.
