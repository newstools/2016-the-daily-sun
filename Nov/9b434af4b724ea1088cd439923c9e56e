A TEACHER who allegedly bathed a five-year-old in bleach has been fired. This comes after Daily Sun recently published a story about how the teacher put the child in bleach to punish her for wetting herself. The incident, at a creche in Soshanguve, Tshwane has been strongly condemned by the Gauteng social development department. MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza was furious after hearing about what had happened to the child, reported to be autistic. &ldquo;The department is bitterly disappointed to hear of toddlers being abused. It is currently National Disability Awareness Month, which should provide us with an opportunity to inspire hope in the ability of South Africans to address the challenges facing people with disabilities,&rdquo; said the MEC. The incident happened last Wednesday at the Mmamerafe Early Learning Centre. The child, who also struggles to speak properly, had apparently been at the centre since she was six months old.
