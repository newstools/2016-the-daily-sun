JOSE Mourinho faces disciplinary action from the Football Association and an almost definite touchline suspension, after being sent to the stands by referee Jon Moss during a 1-1 Premier League home draw with West Ham on Sunday.It is the third time in less than two months that the fiery Manchester United manager will face disciplinary action from the sport s ruling body.He was suspended for one game and fined 8 000 (more than R138 000) in late October for an altercation with referee Mark Clattenburg during a draw with Burnley.That incident followed a 50 000 (more than R862 000) punishment for comments made about the decision to allow referee Anthony Taylor to officiate the game with Liverpool.The latest flashpoint also involved a referee with whom Mourinho has recent history.Last season, while in charge of Chelsea, Mourinho had an altercation with the same official in a game at West Ham which resulted in a one-match stadium ban for the Portuguese.A year on, against the same opposition and with the same referee, Mourinho kicked a water bottle 20 metres to protest Taylor s decision to caution Paul Pogba for simulation after 27 minutes. The card rules the French international out of United s League Cup quarterfinal tie again with West Ham at Old Trafford tomorrow. I think everyone saw his frustration showed in that situation, said assistant manager Rui Faria after Mourinho refused to speak post-match. It should have been a free kick for us but ended with a yellow card for Paul and he is out of our next match. So there are maybe reasons to express some frustration. After those things that are part of the game, the referee took a decision. But I think everything comes from a decision that should have gone the opposite way. By that stage Zlatan Ibrahimovic had equalised after an early opening goal from Diafra Sakho.But, as has been the norm recently, Mourinho s team could not find a winner as they recorded a fourth consecutive home league draw the first time since 1990 they have gone four home games without victory.More worrying yet, United have now recorded their worst start to a season after 13 games since 1989-90, the season that saw Sir Alex Ferguson famously win the FA Cup after surviving calls for his dismissal.
