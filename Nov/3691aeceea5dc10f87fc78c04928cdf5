Orlando Pirates interim coach Augusto Palacios has explained why captain Happy Jele has remained completely frozen out of Bucs' starting line-up since he took over.The 29-year-old has not featured at all in Pirates' last two wins over Free State Stars and Chippa United, and some may have questioned why the experienced right-back is no longer in favour.In fact, Jele's last appearance came in the 6-1 league defeat to SuperSport United in early November. The result saw Muhsin Ertugral resign and Palacios take his place on an interim basis.Nonetheless, the Peruvian mentor has been quick to explain that he hardly ever changes a winning line-up. Since the 64-year-old took over, the Sea Robbers have won three in a row.He told reporters: "My philosophy is clear, if the players in the starting line up are performing, I don't change. Here it's about competition."We have 28 to 29 players and I can't field every player. Jele is the captain but he's not playing at the moment."Thembela Sikhakhane has been used in the right-back role by Palacios during his first three games in charge.The Mayfair-based outfit next face SuperSport United in a Telkom Knockout semi-final on Saturday. The action gets underway from 18:00 at Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit.
