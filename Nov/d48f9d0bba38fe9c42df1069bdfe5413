AN alleged THUG got more than he bargained for when he was attacked by a group of angry shoppers on Tuesday. The man, who shoppers claim is notorious for mugging people in the CBD of Limpopo&rsquo;s Thohoyandou, is believed to have stolen from four other people before he was caught red-handed robbing a gogo. A crowd gathered after they heard the gogo scream. The thug tried to run away but he was cornered at Mvusuludzo Mall. The mall&rsquo;s security battled to contain the crowd and most of the shops had to be closed. The man was dragged to nearby hawkers&rsquo; stalls, where he was severely beaten. There was a stand-off between the cops and angry residents as they waited for an ambulance. Residents accused the cops of helping criminals.Angry crowd members yelled: &ldquo;Criminals who come here won&rsquo;t leave alive.&rdquo; Colonel Mashudu Malelo of Thohoyandou police said a case of attempted murder was opened. &ldquo;We are warning criminals not to come here as people are very angry.&rdquo;He warned the community to control their anger.
