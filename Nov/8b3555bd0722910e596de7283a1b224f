SOMETIMES residents stumble upon dead people in the street.And they say the dead don&rsquo;t even belong to Marikana squatter camp in KwaThema, near Springs in Ekurhuleni.Now they want the killers who dump bodies in their area to stop.Four bodies were found in the space of two months, with the last one being discovered last Sunday. The body was decomposed.Community leader Thembisa Phethela said they suspect people are killed somewhere else and later dumped in their area.The four bodies were all of men. They had been shot or stabbed.&ldquo;We are sure the dead people didn&rsquo;t live among us. We haven&rsquo;t received a report of anyone who has gone missing,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;We may not be living in a formalised area but we are decent. The criminals must stay away.&rdquo; Marikana does not have electricity. &ldquo;Thugs are taking advantage of the darkness and do as they wish. We are not going to allow that,&rdquo; Thembisa said.KwaThema cops confirmed that dead bodies had been found in the area. They are appealing to people who miss relatives to come forward.The Ekurhuleni Municipality said all squatter camps under its control will be getting electricity soon.
