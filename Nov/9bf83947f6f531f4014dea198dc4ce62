CAPE TOWN event organiser, Simphiwe Mtyenene is gatvol with DJ Bongz.Simphiwe said DJ Bongz, real name Bongani Dlamini, was booked to perform at an event at Strand, in Cape Town on 30 October, but he never pitched. Speaking to Sunday Sun, the disgruntled Simphiwe said the DJ was paid the booking fee in full. Said Simphiwe: &ldquo;I paid Mabala Noise, booked flight tickets and rented a car for DJ Bongz but he didn&rsquo;t come. We waited at the airport until the last flight and gave up.&rdquo;Simphiwe said he lost over R50 000 and wants DJ Bongz and Mabala Noise to pay back all his money. Simphiwe went on: &ldquo;I lost a lot of money and my company&rsquo;s reputation is tarnished. People won&rsquo;t come to my events after this and my sponsors are not happy.&rdquo;He said he has approached his lawyer in order to get the money back.Mhlo Gumede of Mabala Noise said: &ldquo;Yes, he was booked. We don&rsquo;t know why he didn&rsquo;t pitch. We haven&rsquo;t yet met with DJ Bongz, he&rsquo;s currently in Durban.&rdquo; When the SunTeam contacted DJ Bongz, he said: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t answer anything. Mabala Noise knows why I didn&rsquo;t pitch. They didn&rsquo;t pay me my share of the booking.&rdquo; Mhlo later said it&rsquo;s an internal issue and they&rsquo;ll refund the event organiser. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try to compensate Simphiwe, we&rsquo;re truly sorry for what happened,&rdquo; said Mhlo.
