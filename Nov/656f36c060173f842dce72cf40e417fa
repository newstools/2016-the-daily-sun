TSHEPO SIBULELO (44) of Soshanguve, Tshwane has been saving for a while.He planned to take his family on a trip that they would never forget. He wanted to spend the Christmas holidays at the beach with his wife and daughter. He said he booked a two-bedroomed suite at the Ritz Hotel in the Mother City.He said he paid the required R12 000 in cash and was left with a balance of R1 200. But his dream will remain just that &ndash; a dream. Tshepo said that he was shocked not to receive a response from the hotel after he had paid the outstanding amount two weeks ago. He called the hotel and was told that the rooms were no longer available.&ldquo;They told me that the hotel was in the process of moving. When I checked online about the rooms, I discovered that they are still available but only cost R4 500 while I paid R12 000.&rdquo;&ldquo;They even sent me a quotation with payment options. They allowed me to pay the first payment and the balance without saying anything to me.&rdquo; He said that if the accommodation is cancelled their dream holiday will be doomed. &ldquo;I am heartbroken because they told me that I will forfeit some of the money. This will mean that I will also lose the money for the other places that we had planned to visit. This is not even our fault but we are going to be punished for it.&rdquo; Jenni Gerber, The Ritz Hotel reservations manager, said that the hotel is in the process of changing location. &ldquo;We are trying to find alternative accommodation for some of our clients who are still interested. Those who are not interested will be refunded.&rdquo;
