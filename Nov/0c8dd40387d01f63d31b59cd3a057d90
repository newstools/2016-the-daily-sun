TODAY is a historic day for the Abathembu nation. Prince Azenathi Dalindyebo (24) will be installed as the nation&rsquo;s acting king.Following a dramatic month of court battles, Azenathi&rsquo;s uncle, Prince Mankunku Dalindyebo, has withdrawn his application in the Grahamstown High Court.The withdrawal, which threatened to block the big day, has led to massive celebrations in the Azenathi camp.Yesterday, Bumbane Great Place outside Mthatha was a hive of activity as inmates supervised by correctional services officers cut grass and cleaned up the yard in preparation for the big day.Speaking to the SunTeam on Tuesday, the recently married university student said he was unfazed by the family faction who were against his coronation.On Wednesday afternoon, Mankunku&rsquo;s lawyer advocate Matthew Mpahlwa made a surprising submission to Judge Gerald Bloem. They had decided to withdraw because Azenathi&rsquo;s mum, Buyiswa Majiki, was present in court and this made Mankunku uncomfortable.Mankunku chose to apply in the Grahamstown High Court because of Majiki being at Mthatha High Court judge.Mankunku and his spokesman, Chief Daludumo Mtirara, have been unavailable for comment.But close family friend of the jailed king and supporter of Azenathi in recent months, Thembu Chief Dumisani Mgudlwa, said Mankunku had been invited to his nephew&rsquo;s coronation.&ldquo;Even before he took Azenathi to court he was invited to attend. We have also invited President Jacob Zuma and his cabinet, as well as the provincial cabinet and traditional leaders and business people. Now that the courts have settled the matter we will see who honours their invite.&rdquo;He also said 15 cows and 50 sheep would be slaughtered for the festivities.Last Friday Azenathi married 19-year-old Amaqwathi princess Ongezwa Zwedala in a ceremony at Bumbane.
