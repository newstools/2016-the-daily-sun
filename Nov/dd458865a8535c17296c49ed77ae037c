M Y USUALLY reserved male friend was ranting about what an utter disappointment his lying ex-girlfriend was. &ldquo;She told me she was pregnant, as the condom had broken. Although surprised, we were happy &ndash; until I became suspicious,&rdquo; he said.Gosh, why do I always have to hear about other people&rsquo;s problems? Why always about my friend&rsquo;s issues with women, while he cheats all the time?As if he heard my thoughts, he said: &ldquo;Me cheating on my wife has nothing to do with a deceitful nyatsi.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a man. And I was proven right that my nyatsi can&rsquo;t be trusted. I invited her out to dinner and gave her a pregnancy test.&ldquo;She was puzzled as to why I&rsquo;d be walking around with a pregnancy test in my pocket.&ldquo;She attempted to laugh the request off, claiming I&rsquo;m childish.&ldquo;It was a Friday night and couples sat whispering promises to each other and stroking egos or necks. The mood was conducive to all sorts of possibilities, but not at our table.&ldquo;At our table sat a man expecting to be a dad or prove her a liar. I&rsquo;m not sure if it was her philandering which gave her away or the text from her best friend. But here I sat wondering and fearing whether I&rsquo;d be a dad.&ldquo;Of course, she avoided taking the pregnancy test on the spot.&ldquo;Either way, I&rsquo;d gone to the pharmacy to take responsibility for the situation. It&rsquo;s challenging for us men.&ldquo;It felt like everyone in the pharmacy was staring at me, thinking I deliberately had unprotected sex. My hands were sweating, but I succeeded to buy the test,&rdquo; he said.After his ranting he suddenly became solemn, saying the entire drama had drained him.The deceitful nyatsi returned to his table flustered and handed him the test with a single strip &ndash; evidence she was never pregnant.&ldquo;She cried, she begged, but I left her there with the aroma of a Cuban cigar,&rdquo; he concluded.Wow. What a man! I was impressed by him ambushing her in a public place for the truth, on the spot.Guys, stop being so gullible. Verify a suspicious pregnancy. Wearing a better quality condom could be a plan. Be bold, protect yourself from vultures who want to entrap you.
