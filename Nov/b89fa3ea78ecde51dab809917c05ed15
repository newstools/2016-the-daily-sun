POLITICAL analyst Ralph Mathekga believes the call for President Jacob Zuma to step down is an attempt to persuade him to walk away.&ldquo;This is an attempt by his colleagues in the National Executive Committee to persuade him to willingly step down,&rdquo; said Mathekga. &ldquo;But Zuma will never step down willingly. Instead, we should expect to see a backlash. The responsibility to remove him rests with the branches. This thing has to go all the way down through the branches,&rdquo; Mathekga told Daily Sun.He said this as news that three other members of the ANC NEC were believed to have backed Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom&rsquo;s call for Zuma to be removed.Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi, Public Works Minister Thulas Nxesi and ANC chief whip in Parliament, Jackson Mthembu, are allegedly supporting the call for Zuma to go.The president was under pressure at St George&rsquo;s Hotel in Tshwane. The ANC NEC meeting which was scheduled to end on Sunday was extended to a fourth day.Political analyst Prince Mashele believes that Zuma could survive the motion because ministers will be worried about their jobs.&ldquo;What Hanekom has done is not risky. He knows that at the moment Zuma is at his weakest. He is vulnerable,&rdquo; Mashele added.Mashele said Hanekom should not be singled out as if he had made the move on his own. He said Hanekom must have spoken to his colleagues. Mashele added that the NEC is the highest decision-making body between conferences and had the power to remove Zuma.
