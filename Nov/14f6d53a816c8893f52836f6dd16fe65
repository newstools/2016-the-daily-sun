&ldquo;A MYSTERIOUS fire ate my dad&rsquo;s bedroom and if it wasn&rsquo;t for my four-year-old son, the damage would have been worse!&rdquo;Khosi Nkosi (33) from Senaone, Soweto, told Daily Sun she still does not understand what started the fire in the bedroom. &ldquo;I woke up at six on Saturday to open the door for the woman who does our laundry and went back to bed. &ldquo;An hour later, I heard my son screaming &ldquo;mama kuyasha! (Mom, there&rsquo;s a fire) &ldquo;I jumped out of bed and when I got to my dad&rsquo;s bedroom, his bed was on fire,&rdquo; said Khosi.She said the fire was spreading quickly and after several attempts to put it out on her own, she decided to scream for help.&ldquo;We tried using water but it seemed we were fuelling the blaze. We only put it out by using sand.&rdquo;Khosi thanked God that her dad had left the previous day to attend a funeral. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what would have happened if he&rsquo;d been here. This is all so confusing because no one smokes in the house and the electrical plugs are on the opposite side of the room.&rdquo;Khosi said her dad lost all his clothes, blankets, bed and R800. She said they did not open a case because they don&rsquo;t suspect anyone for the fire. &ldquo;Yes, we don&rsquo;t know what started the puzzling fire but we don&rsquo;t suspect witchcraft or anyone for that matter. What could have been the motive?&rdquo; Khosi is pleading with SunLanders to donate blankets, a bed, paint and cement to repair the house because they cannot afford to do so.
