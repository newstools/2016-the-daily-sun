Neighbours mustn’t keep quiet when they see abuse. We know that some families don’t talk about abuse to avoid embarrassment. “Abuse must be reported to the police and social workers. Children deserve justice and protection.”He encouraged people to report abuse to the department of social development’s 24-hour call centre and gender based violence command centre. Zuma also appealed to traditional leaders to support rape victims, as well as abused women and kids in their villages.
