SuperSport United captain Dean Furman says the focus has shifted to dominating the Tshwane Derby following their 6-1 thriller against Orlando Pirates in an Absa Premiership encounter&nbsp;on Tuesday&nbsp;night at Mbombela Stadium. Furman understand that performing well in the Telkom Knockout last 8 against their Tshwane rivals Mamelodi Sundowns at Lucas Moripe Stadium&nbsp;on Saturday&nbsp;evening will be more important than their league match with Pirates. The Bafana Bafana midfielder says it&rsquo;s about time Matsatsantsa a Pitori won bragging rights in the much-anticipated Tshwane Derby. United have failed to beat the Caf African Champions League winners Sundowns in the last three years. Stuart Baxter&rsquo;s charges last defeated Downs in the 2012/2013 season. They are determined to end their dry run when they lock horns with Sundowns&nbsp;on Saturday. He said: &ldquo;It is very important that we forget about the Pirates&rsquo; game because the results mean nothing when we face Sundowns on the weekend. &ldquo;Our win&nbsp;on Tuesday&nbsp;means nothing because we didn't win any cup.&nbsp;On Saturday&nbsp;we have to play for a win because this is a cup game.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is about time we dominate the Tshwane Derby. We are hungry for that victory and to lift the silverware.&rdquo;
