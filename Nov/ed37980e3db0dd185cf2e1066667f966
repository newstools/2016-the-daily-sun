OUTGOING Eskom CEO, Brian Molefe, has done what many expected him to do &ndash; he resigned. Even though he claimed that his action was voluntary, we cannot help but think he took it because he could no longer handle pressure. If a person like Molefe can resign, what&rsquo;s to stop President Jacob Zuma from following suit? Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s stunning report revealed the possibility that JZ&rsquo;s not the only public figure to be cosy with the Gupta gang. Other leaders seem likely to be corrupt and compromised. Some people may argue that Molefe has done the honourable thing by resigning.But there was nothing honourable in what he allegedly did. If he thought that by resigning, he has got himself out of hot water, he had better think again. Because the DA and EFF are hot on his heels and a court battle is looming. It&rsquo;s such a sad prospect &ndash; enough to make a guy feel like bursting into tears! OUTGOING Eskom CEO, Brian Molefe, has done what many expected him to do &ndash; he resigned.
