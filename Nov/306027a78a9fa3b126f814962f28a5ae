The government wants residents to think of mosquitoes as they think of guns &ndash; that they are dangerous and also can kill.&ldquo;Mosquitoes are tiny, but they kill more people than guns,&rdquo; said Mandla Zwane, from the Department of Health in Mpumalanga. &ldquo;But if mosquito infections are detected early, they can be easily cured.&rdquo;Zwane was speaking during the Africa Mosquito Awareness Month&rsquo;s event at Naas Stadium near Komatipoort in Mpumalanga. &ldquo;We want people to know that mosquito infections are dangerous. But luckily if detected early, they are easily curable.&rdquo; &ldquo;Symptoms of malaria are fever and vomiting. People with weakened immune systems such as those with HIV and those visiting countries such as Mozambique who still battle with mosquito infections, are likely to catch it. So we appeal to the community to adopt healthy lifestyles and behaviours to prevent illnesses.&rdquo; The department also taught people about healthy living and encouraged them to participate in the fun run they organised on the day. Gogo Elizabeth Zwane (68) took part in the organised events. She said: &ldquo;I was tested for malaria and I&rsquo;m fine. I even took part in the run, which I really enjoyed.&rdquo;Bongani Mabuza (16), who suffers from diabetes, said he learnt that his illness also put him at risk. Asanda Luphoko (18) said she also learnt a lot from the awareness. &ldquo;In this community being healthy is not celebrated. &ldquo;People only appreciate you when you are fat. That&rsquo;s why we are dying every day. &ldquo;We need more awareness campaigns about health so we can stop dying like flies.&rdquo;
