TEACHERS who have been harassing pupils will be taken to court. That was revealed in an urgent media briefing of the commission for the promotion and protection of the rights of cultural, religious and linguistic communities yesterday, referring specifically to pupils who are members of the Nazareth &ldquo;Shembe&rdquo; Church.Chairwoman of the organisation, Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva, addressing the media at their offices in Braamfontein, Joburg said pupils in KZN are the worst affected. &ldquo;The religious principle for the Shembe Church is that they do not cut their hair. This is not new.&rdquo; Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said they have met with the department of education in KZN and they agreed that within 30 days the department will send a directive to all schools telling officials to stop harassing pupils who go to this church, as well as to any other. She said teachers who continue to harass pupils will have disciplinary measures taken against them. She said they thought the matter had been resolved until they met again with church members.&ldquo;We were told that teachers have become even more aggressive. They are now insulting the leadership of the Shembe Church and the religion itself. &ldquo;We have reached the stage where we feel it is very urgent for us to approach the court to say there is a challenge here.&rdquo;She said teachers who have been harassing pupils need to be taken to court. &ldquo;We are taking the matter to the equality court. It is exam time and now these children can&rsquo;t write.&rdquo;On the matter of the commercialisation of religion, Thoko said it&rsquo;s a lie that the commission wants to give the religious sector to the State.
