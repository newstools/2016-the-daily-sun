RESIDENTS of zone 1 in Ga-Rankuwa, north of Tshwane are sick of leaking sewers in their area.A blocked drain is causing sewage to flow down their streets and into the yards of residents.This has been happening for months and despite many calls to the municipality for help, nothing has been done.Angry residents barricaded the main road with stones on Thursday. They said the protest will continue until their situation is resolved.They said when the municipality unblocks the drain, they are back to square one after few days. Resident Alfred Moima (32) said there is kak all over their kasi. Our health is at risk. We can t even open the window when it s hot because of the terrible smell. Sindy Mosima (44), another resident, said they can t host parties because of the smell. Our children cannot play outside because there is kak everywhere and it s not good for our health. Councillor Tshepo Kgatle said that he has taken up the matter with the relevant departments.He said the people who are supposed to unblock the drains work for a private company and are currently on strike. That leaves our residents in a terrible situation, but we are working on it.
