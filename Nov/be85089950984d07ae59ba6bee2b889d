BLESSEE Amanda Cele is accused of theft and causing damage to her former friend&rsquo;s rented property in Sandton!Model Kim Sehume is fuming and wants Amanda to return her designer clothes, two handbags and a Brazilian weave &ndash; all valued at R50 000.&ldquo;I regret the day I felt sorry for Amanda and asked her to come and stay with me. &ldquo;This was last year in July when she said her former housemate in Midrand had kicked her out,&rdquo; she said.Kim said she met Amanda through a mutual friend. &ldquo;She then called asking for a few weeks and I gave her my small room to rent for R3 000 a month. &ldquo;She only paid the full amount once and I&rsquo;ve had to risk being thrown out by the owners because she always paid late. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m now moving because after she damaged the doors to the house, I&rsquo;m scared of living here,&rdquo; said Kim.She said Amanda must work for her money like everyone else.&ldquo;She lied on that TV show when she spoke about being a blessee. She shot the show at someone&rsquo;s apartment and doesn&rsquo;t even own a car. &ldquo;The car was borrowed just for the day to impress the cameras. She works as a hostess and can&rsquo;t even afford her own place. I hope to get my clothes back and I urge her to take care of herself,&rdquo; said Kim.She said the move will help her to regroup and fight back if attacked.&ldquo;I also found a box full of muthi in the room she used to occupy. I&rsquo;m scared she might have cursed me,&rdquo; Kim said.Amanda said: &ldquo;How does her losing her things affect me? We were together Friday night at a club in Sandton. This is f*ck*n crazy!&rdquo; And then she slammed down the phone.
