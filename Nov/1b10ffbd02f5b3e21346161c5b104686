AT NIGHT, the thugs wait for their prey in a mobile toilet. Not even the terrible smell can turn them away from their evil deeds.&nbsp; AS SOON AS THEIR VICTIMS PASS THE TOILETS, THEY FLING THE DOOR OPEN IN THEIR FACES AND PULL THEM INSIDE!&nbsp; The thugs then demand cellphones and cash and if the victims refuse, they scoop up kak and threaten to smear it on their faces! To save themselves from eating a disgusting meal, residents who fall into the thugs&rsquo; evil trap at the mobile toilets in Madelakufa squatter camp, Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, hand over their valuables.&nbsp; Boas Ndlovu said he was on his way home from the tavern one night when he was attacked by the thugs.&nbsp; &ldquo;They demanded money or they said I would have to eat ikaka. When I told them I had spent my money on beer, one of the thugs put a panga in the toilet and scooped out kak. He said if I didn&rsquo;t give him money, he would smear it on my face,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Faced with only two options, I decided to take out a R100 note I had hidden in my sock. I handed it over and they let me go.&rdquo;&nbsp; Boas said since the incident, he had stopped walking past the toilets.&nbsp; &ldquo;They hide in there and you only hear them when they fling the door into your face and pop out,&rdquo; he said. Another victim, Klaas Legodi, said he was on his way to houses opposite the squatter camp when he was cornered by the thugs.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t usually take my cellphone when I go out at night. When they pounced on me, I didn&rsquo;t have a phone or cash,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because I had nothing else to give them, they made me take off my expensive Puma takkies. To spare myself, I gave them my shoes and ended up walking barefoot to my friend&rsquo;s house..&nbsp; &ldquo;My friend laughed when I arrived there but when I told him why I didn&rsquo;t have shoes on he was shocked.&rdquo;&nbsp; Captain Manyadza Ralidzivha advised all the victims affected to visit the police station to open cases. &ldquo;We can only investigate once cases have been opened.&rdquo;&nbsp;
