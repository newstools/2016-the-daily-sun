RESIDENTS of Jabulani View housing complex in Soweto were forcefully evicted by dozens of Red Ants! This was after residents failed to pay rent as part of a boycott.Some residents owe more than R25 000.When Daily Sun arrived at the scene, a dump of furniture and other valuables had been created outside the complex.Nontokozo Mkhize, a mother of two and a resident in the complex, said they are worried about how they are going to get their belongings back. Their biggest worry is finding an alternative place to live.&ldquo;Our valuables, including our bank cards, IDs and other important things are left lying around in the field, and we have nowhere to go.&rdquo;She said some of them don&rsquo;t work and the rent fluctuates for others.&ldquo;Some of us want to pay but we can&rsquo;t pay because the amount has increased. &ldquo;It is too much to pay at once. Some people stopped paying in 2013.&rdquo;The block of flats is owned by Madulammoho Housing Association, which aims to provide affordable housing for low income earners.Dan Bovu, City of Joburg&rsquo;s mayoral committee member for housing, said they will work with the relevant entities to resolve the matter.&ldquo;We spoke to Madulammoho and we established a working relationship.&ldquo;We will discuss how we can continue to assist our people and resolve this difficult matter.&rdquo;
