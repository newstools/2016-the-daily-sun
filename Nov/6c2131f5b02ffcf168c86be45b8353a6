THE residents gathered on Saturday, excitedly waiting for the MMC to announce housing beneficiaries and address waiting list issues.But the MMC didn&rsquo;t arrive.And when the residents heard he was away attending mayor Mzwandile Masina&rsquo;s wedding in Stellenbosch, they went on the rampage.Metro cops had their hands full as they tried to disperse the angry crowd in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni. Each time the cops were able to remove some burning tyres, residents lit a few more. They had a steady supply.Motorists around Chief Luthuli Village in extension two near Cloverdene had to find alternative routes or work their way round the burning tyres blocking streets.The residents said housing MMC Lesiba Mpya didn&rsquo;t honour his appointment.&ldquo;Elected officials don&rsquo;t care about the people who voted them into power,&rdquo; said community leader Happy Cindi.Happy said Mpya was supposed to tell them who would benefit from the RDPs in Chief Luthuli and address those on the waiting list.&ldquo;We have about 50 elders between the ages of 70 and 95 who are renting. &ldquo;The MMC was supposed to tell us whether the desperate elders would be going into the new houses or not,&rdquo; said Happy. Residents continued toyi-toying, adding that people who were allegedly not supposed to benefit had moved into the houses, leaving the real beneficiaries stranded.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about bribes. If you don&rsquo;t have money, you won&rsquo;t get what you want. That&rsquo;s how corrupt our government is,&rdquo; said one resident. Daily Sun spoke to Mpya at Cape Town Airport on Sunday. He said he hadn&rsquo;t committed to meeting the community.&ldquo;My predecessor, Aubrey Nxumalo, made the appointment. Unfortunately it wasn&rsquo;t possible for me to meet the commitment made by someone else. I understand their frustration and promise to meet them on Wednesday,&rdquo; said Mpya.
