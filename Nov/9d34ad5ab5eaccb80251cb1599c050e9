ANC secretary general Gwede Manstashe says the party has an obligation to change the negative narrative about it into a positive one. "Negative narrative is something repeated over and over. The duty of the ANC is to change that narrative into a positive one," he told reporters in Pretoria. "You don't change that by spin doctoring. You change that by talking to the programmes of the ANC."Mantashe added that the only way for the narrative to change was for the leaders to embark on a serious drive to conduct political education with all structures of the party. "When we go and do political education, that must have an impact and it must change the narrative," he said. The national democratic revolution The ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) is meeting in Pretoria to take stock of the work that has been done. Mantashe said the meeting would look at various reports, including the report of the political overview delivered by President Jacob Zuma. "[The political report is] basically giving an overview report on what we are doing as the NEC, ranging from the work we are doing in the regions, correction of selecting of candidates for local government elections. We are also looking seriously into whether the national democratic revolution is on course or is it having a threat to it."Mantashe said the national democratic revolution was the programme of the ANC to achieve a united non-racial, non-sexist democratic and prosperous South Africa.He further indicated that they had observed a moment of silence for President Fidel Castro because of the role he had played as an internationalist and for the impact of the people of Cuba on Southern Africa."As South Africa we are benefitting from the solidarity and relationship we have with Cuba. We will honour Comrade Fidel and we are hoping the state will elevate his role to the right level, even if it would mean the president addressing the nation and sending a delegation to the funeral as South Africa," he said.
