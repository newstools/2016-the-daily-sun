NKOSINATHI Sibanda is HIV-positive and needs to visit the clinic once every two months to collect his medication. However, he claims his bosses have told him the workplace is not a hospital and he should resign because they can&rsquo;t afford to look after a sick person! Nkosinathi, from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun the clinic gave him doctor&rsquo;s notes but his bosses were still not happy. He said he had been given dates for disciplinary hearings four times but his employer kept postponing. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m guilty why can&rsquo;t they fire me? They have been trying to force me to resign.&rdquo; Nkosinathi said he always got a doctor&rsquo;s note a week before he visited the clinic. &ldquo;I show them another note when I come back but they are not convinced. I can&rsquo;t skip my appointments because I won&rsquo;t have pills.&rdquo; He claimed the situation had caused his CD4 count to drop to 73 and he had to be admitted to hospital. Nkosinathi claimed he was told not to come to work until further notice. The SunTeam approached the human resources director at his place of work, Joseph Machaba, who said it wasn&rsquo;t true that Nkosinathi warned them before his clinic appointments. &ldquo;We want employees suffering from chronic diseases to inform us on time so we can adjust our roster.&rdquo; He also disputed Nkosinathi&rsquo;s claim that he was told not to come to work until further notice. Sithembile Tshwete, labour department spokesman, advised him to go to the CCMA.The Treatment Action Campaign said Nkosinathi&rsquo;s rights were being violated and advised him to talk to the organisation to discuss the legal implications of his situation.
