THE toilet system introduced in Ndakana Village, Stutterheim will hopefully improve the lives of residents and save water. On Saturday the department of science and technology launched the &ldquo;low pour flush toilet system&rdquo; to benefit about 120 households in the village in the Amathole Municipality. The system is low maintenance and uses only two litres of water for one flush. The toilet doesn&rsquo;t have a water bowl holding water. Instead, the user takes a jug holding two litres of water to the toilet. They pour the water over their waste, which falls directly into the sewerage pipe. Imraan Patel, the department&rsquo;s deputy director-general for socio-economic innovation partnerships, said: &ldquo;The pilot study started with 20 household toilets, and by now over 600 of these systems have been implemented around the country.&rdquo; Amathole mayor Nomfusi Nxawe said: &ldquo;We are grateful we get to test technology and ways in which to make the lives of our people better.&rdquo;Resident Zonele Gqokweni (65) told Daily Sun this is his first flushing toilet ever.
