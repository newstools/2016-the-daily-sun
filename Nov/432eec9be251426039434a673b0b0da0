THE two cousins were excited about becoming men but when they were told they had to leave their favourite music behind, there was trouble. Bonga (18) and Summer Ngqungqu (19) from Zithulele Village, Mqanduli, went for initiation on Monday. When they arrived, they were told they couldn&rsquo;t bring their smartphones to listen to their favourite rapper, Lil&rsquo;Wayne. According to their ikhankatha, Mveliso Nkani (41), the boys went on a hunger strike when he told them they couldn&rsquo;t take selfies, use social networks or listen to hip hop music. &ldquo;They know tradition doesn&rsquo;t allow them to bring cellphones to initiation school. I hit them and they went on a hunger strike. They want to take selfies and sing along to Lil&rsquo;Wayne&rsquo;s songs instead of traditional Xhosa songs sung by abakhwetha.&rdquo; Mveliso said eventually he decided to leave the two stubborn initiates to do what they wanted because he was scared of being arrested for abuse. Speaking to the SunTeam, Bonga and Summer said would rather die of hunger than give in to the ikhankatha&rsquo;s demands. &ldquo;Our ikhankatha is boring and wants us to speak deep isiXhosa like madalas and sing traditional songs but we prefer to listen to Lil&rsquo;Wayne while updating our social network accounts,&rdquo; said Summer. Madala Njongo Ngqungqu (75) said: &ldquo;I bought a cow and five goats for their return.&ldquo;But it seems all these preparations will be for a funeral instead because they will die of hunger.&rdquo;
