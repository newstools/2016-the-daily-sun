WHEN Simangele Khumalo decided to open her heart and lend a helping hand, she had no idea it would cause her trouble. Thanks to her good deed, her funeral parlour Sma&rsquo;s Funeral Services in KwaMashu, north of Durban is stuck with a body and no relatives have come forward to claim it. One resident said Simangele was trying to help the community, but now she is stuck with a body no one wanted to claim. Simangele told Daily Sun she took the body three weeks ago and every day it was in the mortuary, it cost her more money. &ldquo;The dead woman, Gilda Mutuque (30), was from Mozambique. &ldquo;She died while visiting her friend. &ldquo;The friend couldn&rsquo;t even assist in contacting her relatives,&rdquo; she said. Simangele said she and Councillor Mondli Zwane decided to help the friend after the woman&rsquo;s sudden death. &ldquo;I have been waiting for the councillor to tell me whether he is getting help from the Mozambican Embassy. &ldquo;All I want is for the body to be taken away,&rdquo; she said. Zwane said he had been trying to get the eThekwini Municipality&rsquo;s help with no luck. &ldquo;I have not forgotten this. I have done everything I can think of, but the municipality is not helping,&rdquo; he said. Gilda died on the third of this month after a short illness while she was visiting her friend in J extension in KwaMashu. The friend, Bevinda Mhlanga, said she couldn&rsquo;t afford to transport the body back home.
