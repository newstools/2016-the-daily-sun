WHILE summer rain is bringing relief to most drought-stricken parts of KZN, some residents in rural areas are stressed about the deadly lightning strikes that have claimed the lives of their loved ones.That&rsquo;s why Nomusa Dube-Ncube, the KZN MEC for co-operative governance and traditional affairs, has started a project to roll out lightning conductors in deep rural areas.She launched the project on Sunday at Dlangubo Village in Empangeni, northern KZN.Dube-Ncube said the project was in response to a string of lightning strikes which have claimed lives and destroyed houses across the province over the past few weeks.&ldquo;December and January have traditionally proved to be the most deadly time of the year when it comes to lightning strikes. Last year we witnessed the death of more than 20 people. &ldquo;So far this year we have lost close to 25 people, with five being killed in less than a month.&rdquo; She said the department has partnered with municipalities to ensure that public spaces have these conductors installed.The roll-out includes a massive awareness campaign that encourages residents to buy conductors at their local hardware suppliers for their houses.&ldquo;We have limited resources to install these conductors in every area.&rdquo;Resident Nomagugu Mdlalose (42) said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re hopeful that the conductors will limit the risk of us being struck by lightning.&rdquo;Two weeks ago, two children from Nongoma died after being struck by lightning.
