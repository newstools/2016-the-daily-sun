ORGANISERS of the South African Traditional Music Awards (Satmas) have no choice but to consider this year&rsquo;s run a big fat flop!That&rsquo;s because everything that could go wrong did, especially after big-name celebrities billed for the night failed to pitch for the annual ceremony.Jessica Nkosi, Ukhozi FM radio hosts Bheka &ldquo;Beekay&rdquo; Mchunu, Zimiphi &ldquo;Zimdollar&rdquo; Biyela and Ngizwe Mchunu, Nomzamo Mbatha, as well as KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Social Development, Weziwe Thusi,were among those who pulled a no-show, according to sources.Jessica, popular for her Isibaya acting gig and for hosting the reality show Our Perfect Wedding, was allegedly set to present the Best Indian Album with Deputy Minister in the Presidency, Obed Bapela. Jessica was not available for comment.Nomzamo was surprised when contacted for comment.&ldquo;I never received an invite, otherwise I&rsquo;d have honoured the Satmas,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;Maybe they intended to invite me.&rdquo;Zimdollar claimed she was ill on the day in question.&ldquo;I was supposed to attend and present an award, but I had a sore throat,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo; I informed the organisers that I wouldn&rsquo;t be attending any more.&rdquo;And despite some of the celebs being in attendance, they didn&rsquo;t present any award.&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter why I didn&rsquo;t present an award,&rdquo; Ngizwe said.&ldquo;What matters is I was there, but I had other things to do, so I left early.&rdquo;And the blows didn&rsquo;t end just there. Fans were dealt load-shedding and were deprived of basic creature comforts at the event&rsquo;s main tent.&ldquo;I came here in high spirits, but I&rsquo;m so disappointed. As you can see, there are no lights, we&rsquo;re in darkness and can&rsquo;t even see each other,&rdquo; Dikeledi Kgatla fumed.&ldquo;There were also not enough chairs. We were forced to sit on the grass. The least they could have done was put a carpet in here. I can&rsquo;t believe that a few years ago we were at the Durban ICC, and now we&rsquo;re in a big white tent.&rdquo;Satmas CEO, Zandile Nzimande, also expressed disappointment with the overall turnout of the music showpiece.&ldquo;We had invited a lot of people for this illustrious ceremony,&rdquo; Zandile told the People&rsquo;s Paper.&ldquo;But some of them never pitched for various reasons.&rdquo;This year&rsquo;s event was held at the Umhlathuze Sports Complex in Richards Bay, KZN.
