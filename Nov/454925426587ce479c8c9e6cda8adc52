&ldquo;I&rsquo;M heartbroken. The children I raised have turned their backs on me!&rdquo;These were the sad words of madala William Molema (70) ,whose kids have allegedly thrown him out of the house he built and shared with his dead wife. His kids said they did nothing of the sort &ndash; but that their dad cannot bring his new wife there.&ldquo;They want nothing to do with me. I don&rsquo;t know who else to turn to,&rdquo; said the madala from Mankweng, Polokwane.&ldquo;Their mother, Celia, died last year in June. My children turned their backs on me after their mum&rsquo;s funeral and chased me out of my home,&rdquo; said William, who is now living with his other wife in Seshego. &ldquo;I cannot continue living at my woman&rsquo;s house. My kids are so cruel. They have obtained a protection order against me that prevents me from entering my own home.&rdquo; One of his daughters, Linkie, denied chasing their dad out of his home. &ldquo;We just told him that he cannot come and live with his new wife at this house which he shared with our mum. He must get another place to live with that woman. He is the one who&rsquo;s trying to chase us out.&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t even attend our mum&rsquo;s funeral,&rdquo; said Linkie.
