&nbsp;A Limpopo schoolgirl used her dying breath to tell her family who had stabbed her in her bed early on Saturday morning, police said. The Grade 11 pupil was asleep at home in Nsavulani village outside Giyani when a man got into the house and stabbed her repeatedly, police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Moatshe Ngoape said.Ngoepe said that her family were alerted by her screaming at around 01:00 and when they came out to investigate they saw a man running away.They found her crying and lying in a pool of blood, with a knife next to her."The deceased told them that she was stabbed by a well-known person staying in that village," said Ngoepe.Ngoape said they traced the 22-year-old man she named and arrested him within a few hours.The motive of this killing is still unknown and police investigations are continuing.The suspect will appear before the Giyani Magistrate's Court on Monday on a charge of murder.The fatal stabbing comes a day after President Jacob Zuma launched the annual 16 days of activism against violence directed at women and children, at Lebowakgomo, Limpopo. http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/schoolgirl-stabbed-in-her-bed-identifies-killer-with-dying-breath-20161126
