It pays to be a fighter.I really never asked for anything other than a promise to be kept. #PaidTheMoney.Payment was made after an extraordinary social media war of words between the pair.Mbalula had promised all South African medal winners a monetary &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; upon their return to the country on 23 August.Gold medallists were to earn an additional R100 000, while silver and bronze medallists were to get R70 000 and R50 000, respectively.Hours after the confirmation of the payment, Mbalula took to his Twitter account to take on Viljoen.He said she should not attend this year&rsquo;s South African Sports Awards to be held on 27 November.Viljoen was not nominated for this year&rsquo;s awards.The shortlist for Sport Star of the Year included Wayde van Niekerk, Caster Semenya and Kagiso Rabada.Jenna Ward, Semenya and Phumza Maweni would battle it out for the Sportswoman of the Year award.
