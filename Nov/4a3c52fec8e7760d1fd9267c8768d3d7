WHAT do you do if a snowstorm traps you inside a tiny ice cave that gets smaller every time you exhale because your breath freezes? You use whatever you have available to dig yourself out. In Peter Freuchen&rsquo;s case, it was his own poo.The legendary Danish explorer, who stood just over 2m tall, used his frozen poo to make a chisel. Freuchen used the chisel to dig himself out of the cave. He had been stranded in a storm in Greenland for weeks in 1912. When he dug out of the cave, gangrene had set in and he had to crawl almost 5km back to base camp. He ended up cutting off his own toes, as gangrene infection can be deadly if it spreads. Doctors later removed half his leg.During World War II, Freuchen was in the Danish resistance and was caught by the Nazis. He was sentenced to death but managed to escape. He died of a heart attack in 1957, when he was 71.
