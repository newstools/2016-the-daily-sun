THE Eastern Cape summer initiation season kicks off this week. The Eastern Cape&rsquo;s Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, their House of Traditional Leaders and various other government departments launched the season at Queenstown in the Chris Hani Municipality on Friday.An app has been created to help initiates, parents and traditional surgeons avoid injuries and death this season. The app was built by City Press in partnership with Code for Africa and Open Data Durban. It enables users to check whether traditional surgeons or initiation schools they have chosen are registered with the provincial department of health. Users will also be able to report injured initiates, abuse and illegal surgeons via the app. The app is only available in the Eastern Cape.
