DORAH Mlambo said she was minding her own business while shopping at Cambridge Foods. The next thing a Hyster pallet truck, driven by one of the employees, ran over her toe. Gogo Dorah (68) said the doctor told her that she had fractured her toe and twisted a vein on the injured foot.After five months of pain and R56 000 worth of hospital bills, the gogo wants the shop to pay for putting her life in pain. Gogo Dorah said her children have tried everything to get the shop to take responsibility, but they are now shifting the blame. According to gogo Dorah&rsquo;s son, Linda Xabendlini (43), the shop is now alleging that his mum deliberately threw herself in the face of danger.He said: &ldquo;In an e-mail that we initial got from the supermarket&rsquo;s insurance company, Unison Risk Management Alliance, they claimed the initial investigation into the incident showed that his mum received a warning of an approaching trolley.&rdquo;The supermarket&rsquo;s marketing director, Andrew Stein, said: &ldquo;We administered first-aid in the store before transferring her to a private hospital. As is due process, we assisted her in completing the necessary insurance documents. The insurers have advised us that they are in discussions with the customer&rsquo;s attorneys with the intention of reaching an amicable finalisation on the matter,&rdquo; said Stein.However gogo Dorah said: &ldquo;What attorney? With what? We don&rsquo;t have any attorneys so who are they talking to?&rdquo; Daily Sun called Ouma Ramaru of the Office and Complaints Administrator at Consumer Goods, who said: &ldquo;I will suggest that gogo Dorah lodges a formal complaint with our office. We will facilitate a resolution on the matter.&rdquo;
