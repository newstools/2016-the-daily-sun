NTOBEKO Dlomo from Zonkizizwe kasi in Ekurhuleni was stabbed to death in a suspected robbery last Tuesday. According to her family, she was allegedly murdered by the father of her two kids! The suspect was arrested, but was found dead in a police cell after reportedly hanging himself. Ntobeko&rsquo;s uncle, Vusi Mabaso (55), said the 30-year-old was on her way to work when she bumped into her long-time boyfriend, who she believed was still in prison.&ldquo;He took all the money she had with her and then forced her to withdraw more,&rdquo; said Vusi, adding that his niece had a stab wound in the chest and was left for dead in the street. The boyfriend allegedly used a blanket to kill himself in a police cell. Zandile Mabaso (63), said her daughter&rsquo;s death has left a gaping wound in her heart.&ldquo;My girl sent me money every month. She was in the process of building me a big house. She had already bought building materials. Now all that is gone. I won&rsquo;t have a house any more,&rdquo; she said. Another family member said Ntobeko was in an abusive relationship. &ldquo;The man used to beat her and five weeks ago she had him arrested. We don&rsquo;t know where he came from because we knew that he was arrested. He probably killed her for having him arrested,&rdquo; said the family member who wanted to remain anonymous. Zonkizizwe police spokesman Sergeant Rufus Tema said: &ldquo;A case of murder was opened against the suspect but he was later found dead in a police cell.&ldquo;An inquest docket has been opened.&rdquo;
