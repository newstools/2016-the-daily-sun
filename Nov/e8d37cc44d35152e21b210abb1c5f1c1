OLYMPIC champion Wayde van Niekerk reckons being crowned the SA Sports Star of the Year again is the start of great things to come for him.Van Niekerk stunned the world with an incredible run of 43.03 seconds that saw him smash the long-standing 400m world record Michael Johnson set at the World Championships in 1999. The new record-holder felt honoured to be crowned Sports Star of the Year for the second year running.The sprint star beat fellow Rio Games participant, 800m gold medallist Caster Semenya, and cricketer Kagiso Rabada to scoop the big award at the glittering ceremony held in Bloemfontein on Sunday. The 24-year-old Van Niekerk also won the Sportsman of the Year and People&rsquo;s Choice awards.He said: &ldquo;This is only the beginning of so much more to come &ndash; the 100m, 200m, 400m and building myself as a brand. I am excited to see what lies ahead. I will take every day as it comes and see how it goes.&rdquo;Van Niekerk revealed that he had to overcome many obstacles to get here.He only realised how much of a fan favourite he has become when he arrived on the red carpet at the Sand du Plessis Theatre on Sunday, where adoring fans and aspiring athletes were screaming his name, hoping to meet their role model.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still trying to get used to it. You eventually accept the responsibility that comes with what you have achieved. I represent more than just myself, I represent my family, their name and my country. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only fair to show the appreciation to everyone who creates a positive environment for me to go represent the country.&rdquo;Van Niekerk was delighted that the woman behind his success, Ans Botha, was also honoured as Coach of the Year.&ldquo;I think it was amazing. Tannie Ans knows the game, she represents way more than what we see. I mean, to reach such heights at 74, having athletes that break records, will inspire others to not give up on their dreams.&rdquo;He is looking forward to the IAAF Athletics Awards on Friday, as he has been nominated as World Athlete of the Year.&ldquo;It is a massive award, I am grateful to be nominated with world greats.&rdquo;
