The pastor told Daily Sun God had instructed him to use the killer spray.He said: “This spray is not harmful. As you can see, I use it on myself. “It is chosen to do the work of the Lord. It is not about this insect killer. “I can use anything I am told to use in the name of the Lord.”Rabalago is still continuing to use the insect killer despite a warning from its manufacturer, Tiger Brands. The company expressed anger over the pastor’s practice last Monday.The statement that was issued read: “Using this product for purposes other than what it is intended for poses risks and is dangerous.” The statement said Tiger Brands is in the process of contacting the prophet to ask him to stop spraying it on his church members.In a separate incident at the church, about 50 suspected EFF members disrupted a service at the weekend.According to a source, the group called for the church to be closed.This comes after EFF spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi last week said they will have to visit the church. He tweeted that the EFF will not tolerate the abuse of black people any longer.His second tweet read: “The Prophet of Doom has not heard about what happened to the snake pastor? No problem! The EFF is coming.”Countless attempts to reach Ndlozi proved fruitless.
