RAPPER Riky Rick claims he&rsquo;s from KwaMashu, a township north of Durban, KwaZulu-Natal.So when his fans from that kasi heard he was billed to perform at the Ink Hop Festival, at Princess Magogo Stadium, they spent their hard-earned money to buy tickets to the show. But homeboy never pitched.Last Saturday the Boss Zonke hitmaker, whose real name is Ricardo Makhado, left thousands of his fans disappointed.Some fans told Sunday Sun they waited the whole night for him but to their shock and horror, the show ended in the morning without Riky Rick performing.A disappointed Siyanda Zwide said: &ldquo;I hung around until midnight because I know main acts usually perform at midnight or in the wee hours of the morning. But around 4am, I gave up and walked home.&rdquo;Another gatvol fan, Lungelo Ngcobo, said: &ldquo;What Riky Rick did to us as young KwaMashu rappers who look up to him for inspiration was unfair. He said he was born here and should have treated the festival as his homecoming show.&rdquo;One of the festival organisers, Zoe Shange, told the People&rsquo;s Paper the Sidlukotini hitmaker missed his flight that night.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true he didn&rsquo;t perform. We spoke to his people that evening and they told us he was stuck in Joburg because he had missed his flight,&rdquo; said Zoe.Riky Rick couldn&rsquo;t be reached for comment.Mabala Noise PR manager, Tumi Moatshe, said: &ldquo;Definitely, he missed his flight. He loves performing for his fans and wouldn&rsquo;t snub them for no reason. He respects them.&rdquo;
