WHAT started off as a normal day of shopping ended with allegations of harassment and bad service!According to Uzalo actor, Khaya Dladla, he was harassed at a leading retail store in Durban City, in KZN.The actor took to Twitter to vent his anger and subsequently launched a campaign.&ldquo;GC&rdquo;, as the actor is known in the SABC1 soapie, said he&rsquo;d gone to the store to buy a piece of furniture and was harassed while trying to shop.GC told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;I went to the store to buy a piece of furniture.&ldquo;As I was shopping for this item, I was harassed by the store&rsquo;s employees. &ldquo;Instead of assisting me, they took selfies with me and failed to help me.&ldquo;I spent more than an hour trying to get help but no one was willing to help me. &ldquo;The manager was also not helpful. In fact, the manager didn&rsquo;t even know who to call to assist me.&rdquo;The actor explained: &ldquo;Eventually, I found what I was looking for but it was heavy and I needed someone to carry it for me.&ldquo;I stood there powerless and helpless. &ldquo;I realised no one was willing to assist me so I decided to leave the store.&ldquo;I had to get that item from another shop at a higher price.&rdquo;GC refused to disclose the item.He said after this incident he decided to launch a campaign against the store.&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mind the selfies, but they should have helped me as well.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a customer after all. I was very angry with them, so I started a campaign. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also not relevant what item I wanted to buy.&ldquo;What&rsquo;s important is that I was treated badly at that store, and as a result, I&rsquo;ve decided not to buy there ever again,&rdquo; GC said.Public relations and communications manager of Massmart (a South African firm that owns local brands such as Game, Makro and Builder&rsquo;s Warehouse), Tinabo Majaye-Khupe, said they haven&rsquo;t received GC&rsquo;s complaint. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t received a complaint. We&rsquo;ve attempted to contact Mr Dladla to resolve the matter, but he&rsquo;s been reluctant to engage with us,&rdquo; Tinabo said.
