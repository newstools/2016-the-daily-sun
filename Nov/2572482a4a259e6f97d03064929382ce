SEVERAL disturbing incidents of discrimination against persons living with albinism have been reported in the Mkhanyakude district, northern KZN.Government departments are making enormous efforts to change the mindset of residents about albinism.Albinos are killed across the continent based on the belief that certain body parts of albinistic people can transmit magical muthi powers.Mjaphani Mkhize, founder of Sukumasakhe &ndash; an organisation that organises cultural events in the area &ndash; started a campaign to protect albinos.The campaign called Protect The Albinos kicked off on Sunday at the Hluhluwe CBD. It drew a large crowd of over 5 000 people.&ldquo;We urge residents to fight those who hunt and kill albinos for muthi purposes.&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no place for murderers to hide in our society.&ldquo;We must report such people to the police. &ldquo;We just cannot expect government officials to know things that are happening in our communities. We must blow the whistle and report these evil people,&rdquo; he said.Mjaphani added that the campaign will reach the entire district and surrounding areas. Sangoma James &ldquo;Mkhulu&rdquo; Mthembu &ndash; who is also part of the campaign &ndash; said it bothered him that bogus traditional healers who kill and mutilate albinos claim to be doing so in the name of traditional healing. &ldquo;No herbal mixture of any sort can be mixed with a human being&rsquo;s body parts. &ldquo;That is pure witchcraft and I refuse to be associated with such people,&rdquo; he said.James won many hearts a few months ago after he saved two albino kids from certain deaths.He helped police bust a 28-year-old woman accused of running a syndicate targeting children with albinism and selling them for up to R100 000 for their body parts to willing traditional healers.The well-known traditional healer from Manguzi reported the matter to the cops and the woman was arrested.An albino, Andile Ngcobo (26) from Lindelani outside KwaMashu said he was attacked last month.&ldquo;Wherever we go we have to look over our shoulders because evil people want to kill us.&rdquo;A dismembered body of a 20-year-old albino woman Thandazile Mpunzi was found in a shallow grave at Manguzi last year.
