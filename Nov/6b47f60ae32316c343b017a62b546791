WHEN gogo Dikeledi was still alive, her wish was to have a huge and stylish home. And after Dikeledi Mohono (83) from Phahameng kasi in Mangaung died in 1993, her grandchildren vowed they would make her wish come true. After 23 years, her grandchild managed to raise the money and built a tombstone that looked like the house gogo wanted. But now, even before the tombstone could be completed, evil people have broken the windows that were made for her tombstone. &ldquo;I have not yet unveiled the tombstone officially because is not complete,&rdquo; said her furious grandchild Tebogo Finger (43). He cursed the people who vandalised his gogo&rsquo;s tombstone at Magegenene graveyard in Mangaung. Tebogo said he was surprised when he went to visit the site and found the window of the tombstone broken. &ldquo;My grandmother was a loving person. She is the one who raised me and my siblings. She taught us manners and to respect elders, not just the ones we lived with. She also taught us not to argue. She would tell us to avoid conflict so that there is peace.&rdquo;He said people must show respect for the dead. &ldquo;I am not going to open a case as I believe my ancestors and God will punish them for what they did.&rdquo;
