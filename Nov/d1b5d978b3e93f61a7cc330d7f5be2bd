MARTIN Mogoloane was returning to work on Wednesday after making a delivery for his boss when four men accused him of driving recklessly. They ordered him to park on the side of the road and he obeyed, not knowing he was in for a terrifying ordeal. The four thugs pulled out hammers and demanded his keys. However, the madala was having none of it and fought them off with his fists! The 64-year-old from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni said he was on his way to Germiston from Westonaria when the thugs pounced on him on the N12 highway near Soweto and tried to take his employer&rsquo;s Nissan NP200 bakkie. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember what car the tsotsis were driving. &ldquo;They stopped in front of my bakkie and forced me out. &ldquo;They claimed I had been driving recklessly, but I had a feeling it was a hijacking,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When they asked for the keys, I stood firm and refused. They hit me with hammers but I punched them and kicked like I was a karate man. &ldquo;While I was hitting them, I made sure they couldn&rsquo;t hit my head. The thugs fled after a heavy fight.&rdquo;After the incident, Martin was picked up by the Metro cops and taken to the Bekkersdal Police Station, where his boss Kenny Kruger met him. Kenny told the SunTeam: &ldquo;It makes me feel so bad to see people fighting an old man. &ldquo;I want to thank the cops for helping Martin.&rdquo;Martin said he was strong because from his teenage years until he was 50 he ran long distances and played soccer. He also did lots of press-ups. Bekkersdal police spokeswoman Sergeant Linki Lefakane said no case was opened.
