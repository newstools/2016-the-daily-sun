GOVERNMENT&rsquo;s proposed sugar tax will hit where it hurts most &ndash; in our pockets!This was the cry from members of the Food and Allied Worker Union as they marched to the office of the National Treasury in Tshwane yesterday.The union&rsquo;s president, Artwell Nazo, said they marched against plans to raise tax on sugary beverages as it would cause more job losses.&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t accept this tax. Already 27% of Mzansi&rsquo;s people are unemployed. A sugar tax will increase the levels of poverty.&rdquo;The group of more than 300 workers in the sugar value chain industry handed over a memorandum to the Treasury.The union rejected claims that the lost jobs would be made up elsewhere.&ldquo;We reject arguments that there will suddenly be a lot of factories making bottled spring water or 100% pure juices to employ more people. Those claims are neither practical nor possible.&rdquo; The union said they agreed that South Africa needed a healthy and population with fewer diseases, but added that one job loss is one too many. The union demanded a response from Treasury no later than 7 December.Lwazi Giba, chief risk officer at the Treasury, said they would study the memorandum and respond in seven days.
