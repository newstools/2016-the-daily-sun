KAIZER Chiefs coach Steve Komphela has emphasised that he will continue with the chopping and changing of his starting lineup until they come up with a formation able to grind out results. Chiefs host Cape Town City in an Absa Premiership match at FNB Stadium on Tuesday (7.30pm) and the beleaguered Amakhosi coach is keeping his fingers crossed that his players will be consistent in their performance. They were held to a 1-1 draw by SuperSport United in a league clash played at FNB Stadium on Tuesday. Said Komphela: &ldquo;Teams that perform well are the ones that are consistent. If performance is not consistent it does affect your selection and a whole lot of other factors. &ldquo;If you look back, before the Free State Stars match (lost on penalties, Telkom Knockout) or Mamelodi Sundowns match (2-1 league defeat) it was clear for us to make changes because there was momentum. If we were to play another match surely it would be influenced by what transpired against SuperSport.&rdquo; He went on: &ldquo;It was always going to be difficult at the back of the results we suffered. Players also had mental pressure, as they were meeting their former boss.&ldquo;I believe we have six players at SuperSport and they are literally part of what we have been doing. All those aspects made it a very tough match, as nobody wanted to make mistakes.&rdquo; His SuperSport counterpart, Stuart Baxter, said: &ldquo;This was my first time back at the FNB since I left the club. When you come to this venue to play Chiefs you know it will be a difficult night.&rdquo;
