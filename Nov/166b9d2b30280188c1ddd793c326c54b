Yah ne . . . Looks for note on what to teach young girls . . . Be naked and marry rich maybe?! A shame.The tweet didn&rsquo;t sit well with some of her followers. She was accused of body and slut shaming other women. Most of her Twitter followers hit back and that caused her to remove the tweet.@MahlabaAyanda tweeted: We can dislike Melania without slut shaming. Also comparing her to Michelle due to the latter&rsquo;s classiness &amp; esteem is a no no.@MimiMvakali posted: My feminism says leave her choice out of this. Leave the slut shaming.@GugsM said: We could start teaching girls that they don&rsquo;t deserve to be judged on what they do and don&rsquo;t wear &amp; they shouldn&rsquo;t slut shame other women.After the backlash, Ayanda then deleted her tweet.When called for comment, Ayanda just hung up the phone.
