Nigerian pastor TB Joshua of the Synagogue of All Nations (SCOAN) has re-uploaded his prophecy of the victory of Hilary Clinton in the just concluded US presidential election.The Facebook&nbsp;post was removed on Wednesday&nbsp;following the backlash from Nigerians over the prophesy which turned out to be a lie.According to&nbsp;BBC, TBJ's social media department said that the post was "mistakenly removed and has been re-posted as such is not our policy".The acclaimed man of God came under heavy criticism&nbsp;following his inaccurate prophecy regarding the winner of the election.In the post, Joshua predicted that Clinton would win the election in a "narrow victory" against her Republican rival Donald Trump.TB Joshua claimed that he saw it all in a vision&nbsp;12 days before the election. According to what he saw, the female candidate would win the election.But, on Wednesday morning, in a closely contested election, Trump was declared victorious.http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/tb-joshua-reinstates-clinton-win-prophecy-on-facebook-20161110
