JULIA Noqhakala dreams of studying horticulture and running her own nursery one day. But in the meantime, while she is working to fulfil that dream, she works at a nursery. The 23-year-old from Tsakane in Ekurhuleni said taking care of plants is like looking after people.&ldquo;They need attention, soil, water and food in the form of fertiliser. One must also make sure they are put in a place where there is shade, semi-shade or full sun, depending on the type of plant,&rdquo; said Julia.Her love for plants started when she was about six years old.&ldquo;I would help my gogo plant flowers at their church.&ldquo;When I was about 12, I started working with my mother on a vegetable project,&rdquo; said Julia.She now works at Hardy Plants in Brakpan as the supervisor. &ldquo;The owner, Suzette Coetzee, taught me everything that I wanted to know. Today I know hundreds of plants by name as well as their purpose.&rdquo; She has learnt that plants give her no stress, as people sometimes do. She said: &ldquo;Plants give enjoyment and enrich our homes and communities. They are not only for decoration but are valuable because they give us fresh air in the form of oxygen.&ldquo;Plants such as comfrey are for healing, rosemary and lavender are good for hair, and origanum and mint are cooking herbs.&rdquo;Julia said plants are always happy and this leads to people near them being happy.&ldquo;To keep plants happy you must water them and clean out dead leaves,&rdquo; said Julia.She knows which season each plant likes.&ldquo;Plants like gaura, ferns and victoria are good in winter and they can adapt well to humid KZN weather. Malvas, duranta and periwinkles are good in summer in Gauteng as it&rsquo;s not very hot,&rdquo; said Julia.&ldquo;For a wedding function I recommend plants like gaura, roses, agapanthus and Christmas roses, but it all depends on the mood you want to create.&rdquo;
