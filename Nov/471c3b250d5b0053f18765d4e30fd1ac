PEACEFUL Kgomo&rsquo;s life hit rock bottom when she tested HIV-positive last May.The 21-year-old from Siyabuswa in Mpumalanga said when she and her friends decided to get tested, she got the shock of her life.&ldquo;The nurse told me that I was HIV-positive.&rdquo; Peaceful said she felt as if her life was over.&ldquo;I lost all hope in life. I still don&rsquo;t know how or when I got infected,&rdquo; she added.Peaceful said after days of tears and sleepless nights, with the help of her family she managed to pull herself together.&ldquo;I had an option: to give up on life or to take this as a challenge. My sister and her friends played a big role in helping me get back on my feet.&rdquo; After the shock, Peaceful decided to reach out to other young people who are going through the same pain. &ldquo;My journey made me realise that most young people in my area are ignorant when it comes to HIV/Aids and knowing their status.&rdquo; Today, Peaceful holds HIV/Aids awareness campaigns in her area.&ldquo;I tell my story in the hope of saving those who are HIV-negative. &ldquo;I want people to be more informed about the virus and to know that being HIV-positive is not a death sentence.&rdquo;
