IDAH Mdakane had a strange dream on Saturday night in which a river swallowed her sister while she was preparing to become an inyanga.Idah ignored the dream . . . but it became clear it had been a sign of terrible things to come.This was after Idah&rsquo;s 11-year-old son drowned the very next day!Heartbroken Idah told Daily Sun she wished she had consulted the elders about the dream as it could have saved her son.&ldquo;I never thought the dream symbolised this. Now my son is no more.&rdquo;Her son Kabelo, was playing with six of his friends at Natalspruit Dam in Zonkisizwe, Ekurhuleni on Sunday at about midday. Two of the boys were overcome by the strong current and couldn&rsquo;t swim. Witness Nyeko Baloyi heard screams and ran to the river.&ldquo;I saw two boys being pulled in by the water. I ran to the community to get help,&rdquo; said Ngobeni.Zonkisizwe&rsquo;s emergency services acted, but it was too late for Kabelo. The shattered Mdakane family will appreciate any help with the burial.
