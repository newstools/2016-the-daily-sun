AT NIGHT, Amos sleeps like a baby.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need dogs. My geese are my dogs.&ldquo;They protect me and keep evil spirits and thugs away,&rdquo; said Amos Dladla (58) from Vusimuzi squatter camp in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni.&ldquo;When thugs come into my yard, the geese make a lot of noise and chase them away.&rdquo;Amos said the crime rate is very high where he lives.&ldquo;I am a community leader, so cases of robbery are reported to me. I know how much crime there is.&rdquo; Amos has six of the feathered birds who patrol his yard day and night.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fear anything. They are like my angels.&rdquo;Amos said people ask why it&rsquo;s so difficult to get into his yard. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why people ask me that. Why do they want to know?&rdquo;The neighbours don&rsquo;t come to Amos&rsquo; yard without telling him first.&ldquo;They know they can only enter my yard when I am here. &ldquo;I can control the geese and chase them away if they attack my neighbours,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Geese are good pets.&rdquo; Amos said the only problem is that he can&rsquo;t plant anything because the geese eat almost anything that grows in his yard.&ldquo;They are great at keeping grass short and weeding, but they can&rsquo;t resist my young vegetable seedlings.&rdquo;
