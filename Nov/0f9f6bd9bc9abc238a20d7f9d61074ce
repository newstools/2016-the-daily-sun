THE ICC made a heartfelt appeal to African nations at it started its annual meeting today under the cloud of unprecedented defections.Gambia on Monday formally notified the UN that it was withdrawing from the court, following in the wake of South Africa and Burundi."Don't go," pleaded Senegalese politician Sidiki Kaba, the president of the ICC's Assembly of State Parties meeting in The Hague, Netherlands."In a world criss-crossed by violent extremism... it is urgent and necessary to defend the ideal of justice for all," he said.The tribunal opened in 2002 in The Hague as a court of last resort to try the world's worst crimes. But in his passionate plea, Kaba admitted it was going through a "difficult moment".He acknowledged some had seen "injustice" in the investigations brought before the court so far, but he offered reassurances, saying: "You have been heard."The court had to redouble its efforts to convince countries to return, and to ensure that there was truly universal justice for all, Kaba said.Amid accusations of bias against Africa, Kenya, Namibia and Uganda have also indicated they are considering pulling out of the Rome Statute, the ICC's founding treaty.Currently nine out of the 10 ICC investigations are in African countries. The other is in Georgia."Though the powerful may seek to leave the court, the victims everywhere plead for its involvement," UN human rights commissioner Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/dont-go-icc-officials-appeal-to-african-defectors-20161116&nbsp;
