But their trip was cut short by the devastating news.&ldquo;We were still in KwaThema when neighbours called us in the early hours of the morning, informing us that our house had burned down.&ldquo;I was extremely shocked by the news because as far as we were concerned we had made sure everything was switched off before we left. &ldquo;We quickly rushed back home to see what the neighbours were talking about, and found the shack burned and all our belongings destroyed.&rdquo;Jacob (41) told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what we are going to do. All our hard work has gone up in smoke. Our appliances, furniture, fridge, TV set, clothing, even the children&rsquo;s school clothes, were destroyed. &ldquo;We are forced to live with our neighbours now. We are literally left with nothing and have nowhere to go.&ldquo;We are stranded and pray that God will see us through this situation.&rdquo;
