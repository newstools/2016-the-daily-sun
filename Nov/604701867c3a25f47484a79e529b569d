SOME church members were not impressed when the woman who joined their congregation to find spiritual healing ended up in the arms of their bishop.And when the church members saw her wearing a ring that looked like a snake.A couple members of St John s Church in Malukazi, south of Durban, believe Bishop Ben Mthethwa s current wife doesn t deserve to be their first lady.A church member claimed: We don t know how a real Christian could wear such a ring. A church leader s wife should always set a good example. Another member complained they were surprised by how the bishop formed a relationship with his new wife. She was sick and came for healing. Before we knew it, she also became one of the healers, claimed the member.According to the church member, the bishop s ex-wife then allgedly left the church with her kids.However, Bishop Mthethwa said his church supports his new relationship and is happy he found love with the woman that has healed his heart.He added that true members of the church were aware of the structures put in place to voice their concerns. I don t believe the ring is ungodly. Snakes were created by God and He never said they were satanic. He added that those who claimed Thandazile was evil might be in support of Nora who he said had abandoned him without any valid explanation. I m wondering what they expected after Nora and I lived in separate rooms for the past 11 years. My current wife came to me when I was heartbroken and breathed hope back into my life. Daily Sun tried to trace Nora for comment but no one seemed to know where she lived. The bishop refused to disclose her whereabouts or to give her contact number.
