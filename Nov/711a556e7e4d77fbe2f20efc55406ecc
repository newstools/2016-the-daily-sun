Residents say they blamed Thabo&rsquo;s mum, Mmalefu, and his stepdad for his death.&ldquo;They were abusive towards that boy. He used to complain that his parents were beating him up,&rdquo; they told Daily Sun.Residents also claimed they found Thabo with his hands tied when they arrived at his home, and that he had suffered burn wounds.&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t allow abusive parents in our community,&rdquo; said residents, threatening to burn down the house where Thabo was injured if the cops did nothing. Mmalefu rubbished the allegations, saying: &ldquo;Some people just like to poke their noses in other people&rsquo;s issues. I admit that Thabo got burned but it was not my fault.&ldquo;He burned himself with hot water while trying to make a cup of tea.&rdquo;Captain Nomsa Sekele said the community had the right to open a case if they suspected child abuse, but residents claimed police had refused to open a case.&ldquo;The cops said one of Thabo&rsquo;s relatives should accompany us. Obviously his relatives were not going to accompany us. We are disappointed in the police,&rdquo; they said.
