SHE was repeatedly punched, hit with a broomstick and forced to drink her own pee. Her only crime was telling her friend&rsquo;s mum about the abuse she suffered at the hands of her stepmother. The eight-year-old from block C, near Komatipoort in Mpumalanga, had no choice but to flee her home two months ago. She lived in the bush for three days before a passerby helped her. Rebecca Ndolovu (38) said when she saw the dirty and starving child she thought she was mentally disturbed. &ldquo;I told her I would take her home but the terror I saw in her eyes when I said that made me realise she had been through a very traumatic experience.&rdquo; The girl told Rebecca that her stepmother told her she hated her and she would not get any food.The girl told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I told my friend&rsquo;s mum what was going on and she confronted my stepmother. My stepmother was so angry she punched me and hit me with a broomstick. She then forced me to drink my urine.&rdquo;Rebecca contacted social workers and the girl was placed in a home.The girl&rsquo;s aunt (40) said she had been hit with belts and made to eat her own poo since she was a toddler. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have a say because her father was always present when the abuse occurred.&rdquo; However, the 30-year-old stepmother claimed the girl was making up stories. &ldquo;Whoever she lives with now will see how naughty she is. And they will end up beating her.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s father (33), who works in Joburg, said he would sort the matter out when he returned home. Mpumalanga social development department spokesman Ronnie Masilela confirmed the child was placed in a home.
