GUGU Hlongwane (48) lived alone in her two-roomed shack.It wasn&rsquo;t much of a house but it kept out the rain and cold. But yesterday the shack killed her! Residents and Gugu&rsquo;s neighbours woke up to find that the structure had collapsed on Gugu while she was sleeping.Residents told Daily Sun when they first searched for the shack owner but couldn&rsquo;t find her, they thought luck had intervened and that no one was injured. But then someone saw a leg sticking out from the rubble, and they found that Gugu had been crushed to death.The incident happened in KwaMancinza, north of Durban.Neighbour Cindy Hlophe (53) told Daily Sun she only saw that Gugu&rsquo;s shack had collapsed when she woke up. &ldquo;I called her name several times but she didn&rsquo;t answer. I then called other neighbours and we searched for her.&rdquo;We pulled her out but it was already too late. She was dead.&rdquo; &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t hear any noise at night. I don&rsquo;t know what could have made the mud wall of her shack collapse.&rdquo; She said Gugu had just got a piece job as street sweeper.&ldquo;I last saw her on Wednesday afternoon sweeping the road near our houses. I don&rsquo;t think that she had even been paid for her work.&rdquo; Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane, police spokesman, confirmed the incident. &ldquo;She was certified dead at the scene. An inquest docket was opened at Ntuzuma Police Station for investigation.&rdquo;
