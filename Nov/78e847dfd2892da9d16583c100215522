It is hard to get a clean audit report, it is even harder to retain it and easy to backtrack. It is through working together as a team at the department that we continue to maintain and keep this record. It&rsquo;s efforts by everyone from the Director-General to the Chief Financial Officer and all officials in the department who continue to do their work with diligence. &ldquo;This is a report on how the department accounts for public funds. It is a report to the people of South Africa who hold us accountable for every cent we spend in making their lives better. It is their report more than it is about the department. &ldquo;This award recognises their continued support and unwavering demand for accountability.&rdquo;
