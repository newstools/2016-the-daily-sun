FOUR suspects were bust in possession of counterfeit goods including shoes near KZN&rsquo;s border with Mozambique on Sunday. The cops made the arrests after spotting four vehicles on the R22 in Mbazwana, northern KZN, during their routine crime-prevention duties. When they pulled the vehicles, three bakkies and a minibus taxi, over they were found to be filled with fong kong goods. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the shoes were packed in boxes. &ldquo;The occupants of the vehicles could not provide the police with a satisfactory explanation for how they had got hold of the goods.&ldquo;All four drivers were arrested and charged.&rdquo; Zwane said the suspects would soon be appearing in court.He said sending extra cops to the uMkhanyakude district had produced results by preventing cross-border crime in the northern parts of the province. &ldquo;After the community raised concerns about hijacking and other cross- border crimes, KZN police management sent extra cops to the area. &ldquo;The deployments are bearing fruit as serious crimes seem to have decreased in the area following increased police operations,&rdquo; Zwane said. Major-General Bheki Langa, acting KZN police commissioner, praised the police officers for their dedication to reducing crime in the area.&ldquo;We will continue with these operations in the uMkhanyakude area to limit hijackings and arrest those involved in cross-border crime. I appeal to the community to work with our police officers by providing them with information with regards to wanted criminals in the area,&rdquo; Langa said.
