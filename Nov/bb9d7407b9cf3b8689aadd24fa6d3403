I rushed to see if there was anything I could do. &ldquo;The passengers sustained minor injuries and the driver was not hurt,&rdquo; said Lungelo.He said the driver could not explain what happened because he was crying.&ldquo;But I suspect that the driver lost control of the vehicle as he was going too fast.&rdquo; Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a man was knocked down by a car and died instantly. &ldquo;A case of culpable homicide was opened at KwaMashu Police Station. No arrest has been made,&rdquo; said Zwane.
