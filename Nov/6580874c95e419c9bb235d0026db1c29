They assaulted him before he was handed over to the cops. Sebokeng police said they took the suspect to New Canada, just outside Joburg, where he had left the four boys.Daily Sun joined the police in their search and found the missing boys at an illegal initiation camp amid dusty yellow mine dump heaps.One of the victims told the People&rsquo;s Paper about their living conditions.&ldquo;The guy came on Thursday afternoon and took us to a field in New Canada. &ldquo;He left us there and told us he was going to fetch maize meal and he would be back with more boys,&rdquo; he said.
