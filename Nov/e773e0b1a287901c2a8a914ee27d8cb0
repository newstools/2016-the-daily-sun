GOGO Paulina is very unhappy that people believe she had something to do with the death of her best friend, who died after drinking holy water.Daily Sun reported last week that Zaidah Ngwenyama (69) from Mafambisa, near Naas in Mpumalanga, died after visiting her friend Paulina Mabunda (63), who offered her the holy drink instead of the umqombothi they usually drank.&ldquo;Zaidah was my best friend,&rdquo; said Paulina. &ldquo;We used to talk, drink, dance and laugh together.&ldquo;Last Tuesday I gave her holy water because she complained about her heart beating very fast and battling to breathe. I gave her my holy water, thinking it would help.&rdquo; When the holy water didn&rsquo;t help, gogo Paulina called for help. She hired a car to rush her best friend and her daughters to the clinic.&ldquo;Holy water heals everything. I drank the same water and nothing happened to me. I believe my friend died from a stroke or heart attack.&rdquo;Gogo Zaidah&rsquo;s daughter, Lili Ngwenyama (33), said the gogos loved each other.&ldquo;But I still want my mother&rsquo;s death to be investigated.&rdquo;Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said an inquest docket was opened. The cause of death will only be known after the post mortem has been done.
