NIGERIAN prophet TB Joshua of the Synagogue Church of nations (SCOAN), has predicted that Hillary Clinton will win the US presidential election in a "narrow victory" against her Republican rival Donald Trump.TB Joshua's declaration came as the world's attention turned to the US as voters to get ready to go to the polls on Tuesday 8 November.He announced this while speaking to a packed congregation at the SCOAN on Sunday.TB Jushua claimed that he saw it all in a vision 10 days ago.The cleric prophesied that Clinton will defeat Trump and shared his "vision" on his Facebook page which is followed by over 2,5 million people."Ten days ago, I saw the new President of America with a narrow win," the cleric, who is renowned for his controversial prophetic abilities, began.He, however, said the new president would be visited by many challenges, including attempts to possibly pass a "vote of no confidence" amidst difficulties in the passing of bills."The boat of the new president will be rocked," he said.TB Joshua went further to reveal that two states would be instrumental in Clinton's impending victory at the polls.He also, on the other hand, lauded Clinton's outspoken opponent Donald Trump: "I want to salute the opposition &ndash; a very strong man and courageous."He is my friend because he is very, very courageous. Challenges don't mean anything to him. The more they abuse him, the more he comes out to talk and smile."With several predictions circulating online which forecast a positive outcome for Trump, Joshua clarified that such visions may have been seen at an earlier date."The men of God that said opposite &ndash; maybe they saw it 15 days ago," he said.TB Joshua is renowned for his controversial prophetic abilities.He is on record to have predicted major world events, including the death of iconic pop legend Michael Jackson, ISIS-inspired terror incidents in Paris and the mysterious disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/nigerias-prophet-tb-joshua-says-clinton-will-win-us-election-20161107&nbsp;
