PLEASE bring back our son!This is the plea of the Ngomane family from Pimville in Soweto, whose son was allegedly kidnapped on 20 October.According to Florence Ngomane (56), her son Siyabonga Ngomane (31) went to work on 20 October. Florence said when he did not return home that day they thought he had gone to a friend&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;We got worried when weeks went passed without any word from him. We received a call from his employer informing us he had not been reporting for work,&rdquo; said Florence. The family then received a call demanding R7 000 ransom for Siyabonga&rsquo;s freedom. &ldquo;They threatened we had to pay the money if we wanted to see him alive. They gave us banking details where to deposit the money but we don&rsquo;t have R7 000. &ldquo;Siyabonga is my only son and the breadwinner in the house. He is responsible and has always informed us of his whereabouts,&rdquo; said heartbroken Florence. Siyabonga&rsquo;s sister, Noma Ngomane, said: &ldquo;His two children keep asking where their father is and when he is coming back. &ldquo;A neighbour told us that he had spotted Siyabonga at a squatter camp nearby. We are pleading with whoever is holding him to bring him back. He was last seen wearing a blue Eskom overall.&rdquo;Police spokesman Kay Makhubela said a case of kidnapping was opened. No arrests have been made and cops are investigating.
