Dear MizzBI&rsquo;m 15 years old and I am dating two boys. They are aged 17 and 18 years old. The 18-year-old boyfriend likes to control and tell me what to do. Every time I break up with him, he keeps coming back to ask for forgiveness. And the other guy always cheats on me. Please tell me what to do. I need help. ) MissDear MissYou seem to be caught in some kind of emotional love triangle. This is a very confusing place to be for anyone your age. The big question is: what do you want for yourself? These guys seem to be the ones exerting their opinions on you. When you do not stand up for yourself by specifying what you want and how you want to be treated, you will always end up living according to other people&rsquo;s expectations. It&rsquo;s time to take control of your life.
