WHEN gogo Maria Mahlangu went to withdraw her pension grant money at an ATM last month, a slip came back saying she had insufficient funds. The 70-year-old from Zakheni Village, near KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga, said she was surprised because she had not yet withdrawn her money. Maria immediately went to the Sassa offices in KwaMhlanga to make enquiries.She said an official told her all her money had been withdrawn in Marble Hall, Limpopo!&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how this could have happened because I have never been to that place. This means someone took the money in my account. The officials advised me to make an affidavit at the police station and bring a copy of my ID. &ldquo;I did as I was told, but there has been no feedback ever since,&rdquo; she said, adding that this is her family&rsquo;s only source of income.&ldquo;If the matter is not urgently resolved, my family and I will starve to death. I don&rsquo;t know what we will eat on Christmas Day if the matter is not resolved quickly.&ldquo;I will have to collect cans and sell them for my family to have food.&rdquo; Since the incident, Maria said she has been to Sassa offices many times without getting much help.Sassa spokesman Senzeni Ngubeni said the matter has been noted with great concern. He said an investigation will be done soon to get to the bottom of the issue.&ldquo;We will also be checking on the options of assisting with social relief grant while we are still solving the matter. The beneficiary is advised to open a case of fraud and corruption with the police,&rdquo; added Ngubeni.
