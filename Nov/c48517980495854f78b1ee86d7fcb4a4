WITH the summer initiation season due to start in the next two weeks, a young traditional surgeon is doing his part to educate boys and parents about safety during this important rite of passage.On Monday afternoon Luvo Tonga (37) from Ntabankulu, Eastern Cape gathered schoolboys and he was joined by officials from the SAPS and the department of health to talk about the importance of following rules.Luvo said it was important to do all the required tests and bring affidavits and ID copies of the initiates and their parents.He said at his initiation school, no under-aged boys are accepted.He urged parents to stop convincing traditional surgeons to circumcise their minors for any reason.Luvo said in more than 20 years in the field, he had never caused any deaths because he had learned from his late mentor that nutrition, warm environment and taking good care of the wound was vital to prevent complications.&ldquo;Circumcision is a passage to manhood, not a permit to use illegal substances and be disrespectful in the community,&rdquo; he said.Police spokesman Captain Mlungisi Matidane said Luvo had a great initiative that guaranteed a safe circumcision session. He wished him success and said police would also play their role to make sure illegal activities are punishable.Sabelo Nama from the health department said going for medical check-ups was very important and it was free at government clinics .
