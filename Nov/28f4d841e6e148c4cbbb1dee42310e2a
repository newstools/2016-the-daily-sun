FOR the third time in seven years, Welheminah has applied for an RDP. And for the third time her name has not appeared on the list!Welheminah Ngoepe (44) from Boslaagte Village, Matlala in Limpopo claims that last year when she applied for an RDP, a ward committee member told her she must sleep with him.&ldquo;He said I should sleep with him first or I will never get a house in my life. I refused and I didn&rsquo;t get an RDP.&rdquo;She said she is unemployed and needs a house. &ldquo;It breaks my heart to see other people moving into houses. Some of the people who are getting RDPs now applied at the same time as I did.&rdquo; The villagers are divided after the latest list came back from the department of human settlements. Some needy people are not on the list.The list, shown to the SunTeam, contains the names of people who already have big houses.Welheminah lives in a shack with her five children. Some of them have to sleep on the floor.Villager Matena Maupye (47) said some rich people are getting houses while the poor aren&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Some people live in big houses while using the RDPs for businesses,&rdquo; he said.Matena is not happy with the list.&ldquo;There are people on the list who don&rsquo;t need RDPs. The proper procedure was not followed,&rdquo; he said.The construction of more RDPs has already started.
