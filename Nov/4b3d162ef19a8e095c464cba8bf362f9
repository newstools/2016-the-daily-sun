IF YOU&rsquo;VE ever wanted a way to stay fresh and hydrated the whole day but didn&rsquo;t know how, then you&rsquo;re in luck!&nbsp; And you don&rsquo;t have to go the expensive route either, because water will be your best friend in this&nbsp;regard! Tselane Tsotetsi (24) said she went the water route because she wanted to lose weight. &ldquo;It all started when I mixed water with lemon because I had gained weight. I thought water would help me lose a bit of it,&rdquo; Tselane said. &ldquo;I then met some lady in a taxi and we ended up discussing how my&nbsp;sudden weight gain affected me. She told me to drink lots of water because being dehydrated can sometimes leave you tired,&rdquo; she added. And according to Tselane, water doesn&rsquo;t have to be boring. She mixes hers with lemon, mint, cinnamon,&nbsp;cucumber and ginger. She said this blend helps her stay&nbsp;energised and beats opting for&nbsp;expensive energy boosters. This is how the mixture affects&nbsp;Tselane&rsquo;s body:&nbsp; - Lemon: Helps with her skin and eliminates certain body odours. - Cucumber: Keeps us fuller for longer. - Ginger: Helps with appetite&nbsp;suppression. - Mint: Helps with digestion and cleanses the stomach. It also eliminates chances of Tselane getting piles. - Cinnamon: Adds flavour. Although it took time to warm up to her blend, Tselane said it&rsquo;s worked wonders! &ldquo;On the first day I tried the mixture, I didn&rsquo;t eat as I was full the whole day. I was fresh and productive,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Then, I realised I didn&rsquo;t have to drink the mixture every day because I&rsquo;d experience insomnia. &ldquo;Now, I drink it four times a month. It makes me feel light and hydrated. And my skin is moist and looks&nbsp;amazing!&rdquo; Tselane believes this is the most&nbsp;affordable way to stay energised. But she cautions that the ingredients should be washed thoroughly before&nbsp;being mixed. In agreement with Tselane, Calvin Mhlambi believes water keeps you cool and can be the most organic way to keep fresh and energised. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you mix your water with. My parents recommend water for everything. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learnt that it plays a vital role. After all, our bodies consist of 90%&nbsp;water,&rdquo; Calvin said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mix mine with anything. I make sure I drink enough of it daily.&rdquo;
