ANC veteran Ahmed Kathrada and Bishop Jo Seoka also attended the launch.Save SA said people could show their support by wearing the #SaveSouthAfrica doeks, bandanas and armbands.They also said support could be shown by organising silent protests when the president speaks, and taking part in social media platforms through hashtags.Pityana, who is the chairman of the campaign, said: &ldquo;Today, civil society is saying no to corruption.&rdquo;He said they are also saying no to the president they see as the champion of corruption.&ldquo;We are saying no to a president who admits that he knows people who are stealing from the State, and instead of locking them up, he says he would rather write a book about it.&rdquo;Pityana was referring to a statement Zuma made when he visited Pietermaritzburg a few days ago.&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to wait until the next election. &ldquo;The rot is spreading too fast,&rdquo; said Pityana.
