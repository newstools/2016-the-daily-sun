FOR these residents the RDPs in their area are nothing but a nightmare.A resident from Entukusweni Village near Cato Ridge in Durban, told Daily Sun the RDPs built in their yards early last year have become bonking spots and hideouts for criminals. He claimed that after the houses were completed, municipal workers came back, took the roofs off and left them like that!&ldquo;Our councillor Bongumusa Mkhize said the roofs were removed because the houses had failed inspection. We asked him to have the houses demolished but nothing has been done,&rdquo; said the resident.Another resident said teenagers bonk in the empty houses.&ldquo;I was passing by one of the houses when I heard screaming. I thought someone was being robbed but when I came closer, I saw two teenagers having sex. They didn&rsquo;t see me as they were busy,&rdquo; said the resident.Councillor Mkhize confirmed that the houses failed the inspection.&ldquo;I understand they were supposed to be demolished because they cause problems. I will follow up on this matter,&rdquo; said Mkhize.Tozi Mthethwa, eThekwini Municipality spokeswoman, said no house has failed the inspection.&ldquo;All these houses have passed the National Home Builders Registration Council standards,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Building inspectors have visited house number 107 and verified it is complete and the beneficiary is living in it. The attached photo shows the house.&rdquo;Daily Sun noticed the house in the picture was built to replace a failed house that hasn&rsquo;t been demolished. The People&rsquo;s Paper sent a picture of the house which is still standing, but Mthethwa has not responded.
