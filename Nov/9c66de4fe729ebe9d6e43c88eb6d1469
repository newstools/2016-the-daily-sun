Johannes Mahamba (81) of Ga-Tsebe Village near Mabopane, Tshwane is a heartbroken man. Thugs struck in the middle of the night and stole his means of making a living.His two sheep and a lamb were stolen in the early hours of Sunday morning.And he suspects that sangomas are behind the theft.According to him, two men dressed in sangoma clothing came to his house on Saturday.He said the men asked him if he would sell them a sheep. &ldquo;The sangomas told me they had some rituals they needed to perform and needed a sheep. I told them I was not selling anything because they looked suspicious to me.&rdquo; According to the madala, the men left without trying to convince him.He said at first when they approached him they seemed like they were desperate. But he was surprised by their response when he refused to sell to his sheep.&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think much of their response until later when I saw that two of my sheep and a lamb were missing from my kraal.&rdquo;He said he was woken up by lightning in the middle of the night. &ldquo;When I saw the lightning I had a feeling that I should check on my livestock. When I got there I found my kraal&rsquo;s fence open.&ldquo;I was shocked. I checked to see if my animals were all there, only to find that some were missing.&rdquo; Johannes said he feared that the thugs would come back and steal the few remaining animals.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m heartbroken because those animals provide for my family. If people keep coming and taking them I will end up with nothing. And I won&rsquo;t be able to support my family.&rdquo; Johannes said he didn&rsquo;t report the matter to cops. However, he appeals to people to help him fence his kraal.
