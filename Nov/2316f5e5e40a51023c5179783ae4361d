THE body of a child believed to be 3-year old toddler Everite Chauke who was swept away during flash floods in Alexandra has been found in the Juskskei River in Buccleuch, north of Johannesburg.Police spokesman Kay Makhubela told News24: "A body was found by community members today. While rebuilding their home, the people found a child among the rubble." Makhubela said cops weren&rsquo;t sure if the child was indeed Everite, but her family would soon be going to see if it was her body.Since the 3-year-old was swept away by the flooded Jukskei River on 9 November the search team had moved from Alexandra to Hartbeespoort Dam, north-west of Gauteng.Police completed their search of the dam on Monday.Everite, her father Shadrick, and his wife Cynthia were in their makeshift home in Alexandra, next to the Jukskei River, when it started raining heavily. When water began filling their dwelling they climbed a tree.The mother was on one branch and father and daughter on another. The branch broke and Everite fell into the water. Shadrick jumped in after her, but was forced to swim back to safety without her.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/toddlers-body-found-in-jukskei-river-20161122
