EACH passing day, Joseph Ndawane is exposed to cold and rain. The 48-year-old from Mhlabuyalingana, northern KZN said for the past five years heavy rain has been slowly destroying his mud house.Joseph, who is unemployed, said he uses logs from a nearby forest to fix the damage.He said he has been living in the same mud house with his son Ntokozo Ncube (17) since 2000.But, sadly, his son was stabbed to death in September and now he is left alone. &ldquo;My son was doing grade 10. He was my last hope of getting out of this poverty and now he is gone. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who will help me leave this miserable life.&ldquo;Maybe hell is better than this life here.&rdquo; He added that he came to live in the area after the death of his parents. Joseph said at that time he was only 20 years old.&ldquo;I had to build my own life and home. When I came here I had little money. I bought a few bags of cement and started building the very same house which is falling apart. &ldquo;I feel like I am a burden to my neighbours who give me food and clothes. All I need is a proper house so I can live like a human being and not an animal. I have reported my matter to the councillor several times but nothing has happened.&rdquo; Johnson Gwala, the ward councillor said he was aware of the condition of Ndawane&rsquo;s house and was working on helping him.&ldquo;As a new councillor I have visited him and I am treating his situation as a disaster. &ldquo;I have reported it to the local municipality.&rdquo;
