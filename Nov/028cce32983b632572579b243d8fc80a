JULIUS Maphako (46) and Stanley Tupu (31) from Siyandhani in Limpopo sell toy cars made from wire and iron in the Giyani CBD.It keeps them from hardship and feeds their families as well. Julius said they started selling toy cars two years ago. &ldquo;We realised that many people loved them. &ldquo;We used to go from door to door, trying to sell toys because we noticed that many children begged their parents to buy our cars. We realised we could make a living.&rdquo;Both men are from Zimbabwe and are sending money to their families back home.Julius said: &ldquo;With the money I make here I&rsquo;m able to look after my wife and three children. When Stanley and I arrived in South Africa life was difficult.&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t want to commit crime so we looked for jobs. After failing to get work we started to sell wire cars.&ldquo;We have been making cars for the past 25 years, since the days of our youth.&rdquo;They sell the cars for between R70 and R450, depending on the size. They also make tractors, buses and trucks.Stanley urged the youth to try and create employment for themselves.&ldquo;People must stop wandering up and down looking for alcohol and drugs. They must focus on things that will help them make a decent living.&rdquo; &ndash; AENS
