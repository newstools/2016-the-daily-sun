AFTER three failed attempts were made on his life in 10 months, Stephen Ratseane lived in fear. And on Tuesday morning, the worst happened and he was shot three times in Vuka section of Sharpeville in the Vaal.The 24-year-old&rsquo;s problems started when he was allegedly given nyaope to sell by gangsters and ended up spending the money he made. According to Stephen&rsquo;s friend, who witnessed the murder but didn&rsquo;t want to be named, an armed man walked into his yard and shot Stephen dead. &ldquo;I heard gunshots and ran for my life. When I returned a few moments later, I found Stephen lying in a pool of blood. The shooter was nowhere to be seen,&rdquo; he said. Stephen&rsquo;s heartbroken mum Elizabeth said he had to move after a group of thugs armed with guns and knobkerries arrived at her house looking for him. She said Stephen was stabbed 13 times in July. &ldquo;The thugs came one day after he had been released from hospital and demanded to see Stephen. I called the police and they pulled out their guns before fleeing on foot.&ldquo;When I asked Stephen what the men wanted, he said he had spent the money he made selling nyaope and the thugs tried to get him to sell another package but he refused.&rdquo; Last month, they broke into Stephen&rsquo;s shack and shot at him but he managed to get away. He went to live with friends but the men found him. Warrant Officer Simon Mofokatsane said a case of murder was opened.
