A TEENAGER whose school days are a thing of the past celebrated her final day of exams by cutting her trousers so short that her bum stuck out!The girl stopped the show on Friday at a high school in Mabopane, Tshwane, as she put her body on display for the boys to admire.The girl played along by dancing with them while other girls were amazed by her shamelessly sexy moves. The pupils said it had been a long year and they had been waiting for this day since they started exams.One of the pupils said they are entitled to celebrate because of the hard work they&rsquo;d been putting in.&ldquo;We were studying non-stop. We never had a chance to have some fun,&rdquo; she said. Some pupils celebrated by burning their pens and books.These pupils were not the only ones celebrating the last day of school as the class of 2016 matriculants took their excitement to the streets.In most townships across the country, pupils screamed as they left the school premises without the fear of teachers shouting at them.Taxis blasted loud music as pupils danced. Other pupils cut and signed what was left of their uniforms.
