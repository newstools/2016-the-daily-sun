It's been a tough economic year, but the Patrice Motsepe Foundation yesterday took major steps to spread joy. The foundation donated R1,2 million to eight schools and churches in Umlazi, KZN. St Augustine Anglican Church in V Section was the centre of happiness when the Mamelodi Sundowns owner and his wife Precious Moloi-Motsepe went to the church yesterday. Today, the foundation will meet traditional leaders in Sandton, north of Joburg, where the leaders will receive money to uplift their communities. As they do every year, the foundation will be touring all nine provinces to share their wealth.&nbsp; Motsepe said: &ldquo;This is the least we can do for our people. We will also hand out Christmas gifts to children in December.&rdquo; Motsepe said they would monitor whether the donated money was being used correctly.&nbsp; Representatives from the various institutions received the donations on behalf of their organisations and pledged to use the money wisely.&nbsp; They promised to build a laboratory at a school, refurbish a church and build a stage for children to perform. The eight KZN beneficiaries are KwaMashu Christian Centre, St Augustine&rsquo;s Anglican Church, Umlazi High School, Ogwini Methodist Church of South Africa, Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Thamela Primary School, Fortress of Hope International and Khama Mthethwa&rsquo;s Church Oasis Fellowship church.&nbsp;
