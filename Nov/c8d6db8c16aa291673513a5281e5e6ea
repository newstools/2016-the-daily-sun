LERATO Hani&rsquo;s life is a kak mess! After several unsuccessful surgeries to fix her excretion problem, she has to use a colostomy bag.And the family complained nurses won&rsquo;t give the 32-year-old from Tsakane in Ekurhuleni enough bags. Said Nomathamsanqa Hani (27): &ldquo;My sister&rsquo;s problem started last year after feeling constipated. &ldquo;Her stomach started swelling and I began to worry.&rdquo; She took Lerato to Pholosong Hospital. &ldquo;We were told she had to undergo an operation. I agreed and signed on her behalf since she has a disability.&rdquo;But three operations later, the problem hasn&rsquo;t been solved. &ldquo;She now uses colostomy bags and isn&rsquo;t recovering well. I have to fight to get enough colostomy bags.&rdquo;She told the SunTeam it isn&rsquo;t fair on her or on Lerato to have to wash her sister&rsquo;s kak. &ldquo;Sometimes she has an upset stomach and the bags get full quickly.&rdquo;Nomathamsanqa claimed at some point she had to leave Lerato at the hospital because they were refusing to give her colostomy bags. Health department spokesman Steve Mabona told Daily Sun because Lerato is unable to do things independently, the family was advised to manage the colostomy bag. He said one bag can be used up to seven days. &ldquo;On 4 November Lerato was brought in by ambulance. The doctor saw the bag was leaking and kept her overnight for stoma care. The bag was changed and Tramadol medication given. &ldquo;On Saturday she was discharged in a stable condition and her sister was given seven bags.&rdquo;
