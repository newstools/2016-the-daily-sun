GOLDEN Arrows&rsquo; technical staff regard their Absa Premiership match against Polokwane City tonight as a six-pointer. Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende will meet City at the Princess Magogo Stadium in KwaMashu (7.30pm) in a match the hosts hope will see them return to winning ways. Arrows were humiliated by the defending champions, Mamelodi Sundowns, a week ago when they were beaten 3-0. Following both their other defeats this season, however, Arrows were able to come back and win the next match. Clinton Larsen is hoping that feat will be repeated when they face Rise and Shine: &ldquo;For me, this match is a six-pointer for us. Polokwane have been doing fairly well this season. &ldquo;We want to remain in the top eight. We want go into the Christmas break in the top part of the table. So victory for us will certainly help us.&rdquo; The first match Arrows lost in this campaign was to Orlando Pirates &ndash; their very first match of the season. But they came back to win three matches in a row. Their second defeat came three weeks ago to Platinum Stars and again they managed to win the next match by beating Highlands Park away. It remains to be seen whether they will be able to repeat the feat again tonight. &ldquo;We are playing at home and we would like to win it,&rdquo; Larsen added. &ldquo;City won&rsquo;t be pushovers, though. They really have improved this season, especially at the back. Their defensive organisation will be hard to break. &ldquo;They have good forward players such as Thobani Mncwango and Sipho Jembula, with Jabulani Maluleke starting all the attacks in midfield. But I have to add, we are ready for them.&rdquo; Larsen said Clifford Miheso had recovered from his injury and was fit for selection. Lehlohonolo Nonyane will miss this one but will be back against Ajax CT this weekend.
