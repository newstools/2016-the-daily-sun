INSIDE the school, Matrics were finding it difficult to concentrate as they tackled their difficult maths paper. That&rsquo;s because outside the St George&rsquo;s School about 100 angry protesting parents from Lubhacweni Village in Mount Frere threatened to disrupt it and even burn it down. They were angered by the recent announcement by the department of education and the high school&rsquo;s principal that primary school grades would no longer be accommodated at the school from next year.Parent and SGB member Eliot Zangqa said: &ldquo;When the school was built the department knew it was a primary school. &ldquo;Our children are not going anywhere. The department should build a high school, not evict our children. There is enough space to build a new school. We are willing to co-operate with the high school until their school is finished.&rdquo; Welile Qhata, the high school principal said: &ldquo;The school is overcrowded, forcing lower grades to sit outside while the Matric exams are under way.&rdquo; Mncedisi Madlala, the primary school principal, said he hoped the department would intervene to prevent the possible disruption of classes.Malibongwe Mtima, spokesman for the department of education, said the matter would be investigated.
