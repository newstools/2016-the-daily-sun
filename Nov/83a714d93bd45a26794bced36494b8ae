THE afternoon is the busiest time of the day for motorists on the road who would do anything to get home early and rest.And on Wednesday afternoon, motorists from Hillcrest and other areas around Pinetown, west of Durban had a hectic afternoon on the M13 highway near Gillitts.They spent hours on the road after a light delivery truck caught fire in the middle of the highway and caused a major delay for the traffic flow.Netcare 911 spokeswoman Athlenda Mathe said it was very fortunate that the truck driver managed to escape unharmed as the blaze swallowed the vehicle. &ldquo;Our rescue officers worked alongside the KZN Fire Department on scene to put it out,&rdquo; she said.Mathe also said that due to the vehicle ending up stationary on the island in the middle of the highway, the incident resulted in serious traffic congestion.&ldquo;The cause of the fire is still being investigated by the relevant authorities,&rdquo; she added. Motorist Mondli Khanyile (33) from Embo Village said the incident forced him to take another route as traffic was moving slowly. &ldquo;Fortunately, no other vehicle was affected. &ldquo;When a car suddenly stops in the middle of the highway, other vehicles behind it are at risk of crashing. &ldquo;Luckily, the driver managed to quickly pull the truck from his lane to an island. &ldquo;But the thick smoke covered the area and motorists had to slow down and drive with caution,&rdquo; he said.KZN Road Traffic Inspectorate spokeswoman Zinhle Mngomezulu said she had no knowledge of the incident.KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said the incident had not been reported to the cops.
