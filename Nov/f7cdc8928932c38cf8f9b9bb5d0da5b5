HEALTH Minister Aaron Motsoaledi says breastfeeding is the best way to keep babies healthy. He was speaking yesterday at the a World Prematurity Day event held at the multi-purpose hall in Winterveld, Tshwane.He said although some might think breastfeeding is outdated, mothers need to practise it religiously. &ldquo;Breastfeeding has many advantages for the health of babies and their mothers. It helps in preventing many illnesses and diseases which can be avoided. We must ensure that every single mother gives her baby mother&rsquo;s milk for the first six months of its life,&rdquo; he said. The minister said 38 out of every 1 000 babies born in South Africa died before their time. &ldquo;Prematurity is one of the three major causes of newborn deaths in SA. The health department will continue to work with stakeholders to improve newborn care. We will also work on improving the health and nutrition of children under the age of five,&rdquo; he said. He lashed out at young girls in townships who fall pregnant at an early age. &ldquo;There is a new trend of men calling themselves blessers who abuse their economic power by impregnating young girls instead of advancing the economy. They are cowards who target young girls and leave them with unwanted pregnancies and diseases,&rdquo; he said.
