MAGGIE Mokwena thanks God for the rat that saved the lives of herself and her two kids. Her home of four years was destroyed in a mysterious fire in the early hours of Thursday morning. The 27-year-old single mum from Ga-Moretsele Village, outside Jane Furse in Limpopo, told Daily Sun she was sleeping when she felt a rat on her face. When she woke up, she realised it had jumped down from a wardrobe that was on fire. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what saved me and my children, because we were all fast asleep when my shack caught fire,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I always complained about rats in my shack but the Messiah rat saved me from death. &ldquo;I am grateful no one was injured or killed but I am devastated as the fire ate everything I owned. It will take me years to recover from this loss.&rdquo; She and her kids, Kagiso (9) and Prudence (5) were left with no clothes, no food and nowhere to sleep.They had to seek shelter at neighbours&rsquo; houses as they wait for someone to help them rebuild their lives. &ldquo;I am not working, which is why I couldn&rsquo;t afford to live in a proper house. &ldquo;Now our lives will be even worse,&rdquo; said Maggie. Neighbour Robin Mashegwane (45) said: &ldquo;We tried to help but the fire was too strong. We didn&rsquo;t have enough water to put it out as we have to fetch water from a nearby river.&rdquo; Councillor Peter Rankwe said he was aware of the situation. &ldquo;We will intervene to help the family.&rdquo;
