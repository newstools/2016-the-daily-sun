THE MAN who was forced into a coffin and threatened with death by fire stands silently, seemingly still traumatised by his terrible experience.&nbsp;But dancing around excitedly in front of the cameras are members and representatives of the ANC, the DA and the EFF.&nbsp; ARE THEY WORRIED ABOUT THE VICTIM &ndash; OR ARE THEY GRANDSTANDING FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR PARTIES?&nbsp; The three political parties came out to support Victor Mlotshwa (27) of Blinkpan, near Bethal, Mpumalanga at the Middelburg Magistrates Court yesterday. The two mlungus, Willem Oosthuizen and Theo Jackson, were arrested on Monday last week. Outside court, people from the different parties pushed each other around for media attention, each determined to take centre stage.&nbsp; In the end the ANC won the battle! They had the star of the show, Victor, as well as his mother and his family. He was on display like a trophy, decorated with an ANC T-shirt.&nbsp; Victor is the man in a video clip which shows two mlungus forcing him into a coffin. He is heard crying amid threats, shouted in Afrikaans, that he would be set alight and a snake put in the coffin with him. Not even the collapse of Victor&rsquo;s mum stopped the crowd. She was eventually rushed to hospital in an ambulance, which deputy ANCYL president Desmond Moela described as just a trip to the hospital for trauma counselling. Addressing his supporters, Moela called the EFF and DA political prostitutes, whose coalition sought to take advantage of Victor&rsquo;s plight. &ldquo;Victor is a card-carrying member of the ANC and an ANCYL member,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No one, including the EFF, can use this comrade for their own agendas. He is already our member.&rdquo;&nbsp; Speedy Mashilo, human settlements MEC and an ANC regional leader, said the whole of South Africa is embarrassed by the actions of the two white men.&nbsp; He said not all whites are racist. &ldquo;We have the same blood.&rdquo;&nbsp; An EFF truck parked about 50 metres away blared out struggle songs and speeches.&nbsp; Mbuyiseni Ndlozi of the EFF said black people continue to be treated like monkeys.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are not afraid to treat black people as if we are nothing,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;We live in our country as if we are visitors. We are still begging for jobs from them.&rdquo; The two accused opted to give up their bail bid to stay behind bars. The case was postponed to 25 January next year for further investigation. Meanwhile, Victor has finally spoken out about the incident. He said he was taking a path across the farm when he was stopped by the two men.&nbsp; &ldquo;They accused me of being a thief and beat me up,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ran and they chased me in their bakkies. When they caught me they took me to the farm where the beating continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then they forced me into the coffin, threatening to set me alight. They also threatened to put a snake inside the coffin with me. I have never been so terrified in my life.&rdquo; Victor did not say how he finally got away.&nbsp;
