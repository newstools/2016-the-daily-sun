POPULAR Malawi-born prophet Shepherd Bushiri (Major One) is known to be living large in Mzansi.But members of his church, Enlightened Christian Gathering (ECG), complain they&rsquo;ve been emptying their pockets to build a church in Midrand.The church services are held at rented premises in Pretoria North. These allegations by church members came after rumours about Bushiri&rsquo;s right-hand man, prophet Justice Hara.Mpho Mokoena and her husband Thapelo Motsepe said they pledged R500 000.&ldquo;Our money is wasted,&rdquo; said the couple. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s still no church.&rdquo;Businessman Ogbuagu Akinsemoyin said he donated R1 million toward the construction of the church.A Sunday Sun source said: &ldquo;Prophet Hara allegedly bought Lebo Nemasiwana a house worth R6 million in an upmarket estate.&rdquo;Another church member said: &ldquo;Lebo was also spoilt with a BMW i8. &ldquo;Prophet Hara is doing this, yet he has a wife in Malawi.&rdquo;The SunTeam visited the said estate in Midrand. The occupant of the house on it, indeed Lebo Nemasiwana, said: &ldquo;Church people always complain. &ldquo;They should face Major One, not me.&rdquo;Church spokesperson, Angela Nee, said Major One is investigating pastors who are stealing money to spend on women.She confirmed land was bought in Midrand for a church, and said one businessman had pledged R20 million.Angela also spoke on behalf of Prophet Hara.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s admitted to knowing a 23-year-old woman, but won&rsquo;t comment further.&rdquo;
