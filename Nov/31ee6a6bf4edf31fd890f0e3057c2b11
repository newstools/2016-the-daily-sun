AN ELEVEN-month-old baby allegedly died after being fed mashed potato.According to his father, Olympic Molomo (32), Blessing Nkaone did not show any signs of being ill when she was dropped at Dolphins English Bible Nursery and Pre-School at extension 20 in Olievenhoutbosch, Tshwane on Wednesday morning.He said the only problem Blessing had was teething. Olympic said his wife, Nthabiseng Nkaone (29), was surprised when she was called to the principal&rsquo;s office when she went to collect Blessing in the afternoon.&ldquo;The principal told her our baby was rushed to a community clinic in extension 13.&rdquo; Olympic said his wife rushed to the clinic where nurses allegedly told her the baby was brought to the clinic long after she had died. &ldquo;I think my baby was fed hard mashed potatoes and choked her. A worker at the creche told me the baby started choking while she was being fed,&rdquo; Olympic said.The principal of the creche said: &ldquo;The child was vomiting every time she ate and we informed them about it.&rdquo; The principal said the baby died on the way to the clinic.Olympic said the principal is lying. &ldquo;She never spoke to us about our child&rsquo;s sickness. She knows what they did was horrible and they are just trying to save themselves.&rdquo; Police spokesman Captain Thomas Mufamadi said an inquest was opened. &ldquo;No one has been arrested. We are still investigating.&rdquo;
