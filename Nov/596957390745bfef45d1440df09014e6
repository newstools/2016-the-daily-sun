ON WEDNESDAY, the nation was shocked by the contents of the State Capture report.&nbsp; Many were left wondering what was next for President Jacob&nbsp;Zuma.&nbsp; AND YESTERDAY, 101 ANC STALWARTS CALLED ON&nbsp;ZUMA TO FACE THE MUSIC AND ANSWER TO THE MESS&nbsp;HE'S MADE.&nbsp;Speaking at a media briefing in Joburg, Reverend Frank Chikane said: &ldquo;We are delegated to present what the stalwarts of the ANC movement want to be presented to the citizens of South Africa. If you have missed this briefing, you have missed out on history. &ldquo;There has never been a gathering of stalwarts like this before, which indicates the level of concern about the direction the country is taking and the state of the movement itself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Chikane said they felt the need to have a meeting with the president and sent him a letter two months ago but had still not had the chance to sit down with Zuma. &ldquo;The elders of the movement are here to make sure there is an intervention to change the tragic direction the ANC is moving in and to go back to what the movement should be about,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Another ANC veteran, Cheryl Carolus, said Zuma was ruining the name of the party.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our country is burning and we are missing in action. Our president has brought shame to our organisation and our country through corruption and working with forces that don&rsquo;t care about our country.&rdquo;&nbsp; Carolus said like the rest of South Africa, they were shocked by recent events and attempts to address them privately behind closed doors had failed.&nbsp; She said the findings of former public protector Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s report were not the only thing worrying stalwarts.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our president has surrounded himself with people of very questionable origin and behaviour. Those around him have also successfully marginalised anyone with decency or who acts in defence of the values of the African National Congress,&rdquo; said Carolus. She said Zuma had abused state power and resources and stood in the way of people such as the Public Protector, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and former Hawks head, Anwa Dramat.&nbsp; Former president Thabo Mbeki has written to Zuma, pleading with him to have a meeting with the veterans about his leadership and the direction the country is taking.&nbsp; The veterans, including Rivonia trialists Ahmed Kathrada and Andrew Mlangeni, last week expressed their frustration with Luthuli House, saying their attempts to speak to Zuma had been ignored and that Secretary General Gwede Mantashe&rsquo;s office had shown no urgency in addressing their concerns.&nbsp;
