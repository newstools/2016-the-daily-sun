&ldquo;MY BOSS is a beast!&rdquo; Langelihle Mthiyane (22) from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni said his manager moered him. He works at a restaurant in East Rand Mall, and claimed the trouble started when a couple politely called him to say there was a human hair in a plate of food. Langelihle said he didn&rsquo;t think racism was still a problem in South Africa until he started working at the restaurant. &ldquo;I took the plate from the customer to change it and I suddenly got punched by a fist &ndash; it was my manager,&rdquo; he said. When the SunTeam called the restaurant to speak to the manager, the person who answered the phone claimed he wasn&rsquo;t there. Sergeant Cebiswa Maseko said a case was opened at the Boksburg Police Station. &ldquo;No suspect has been arrested but an investigation is underway,&rdquo; she said.
