PEOPLE often go to sangomas to get help.But what happens when a sangoma needs advice . . .Skhumbuzo Shongwe (30), from extension two in Lawley, south of Joburg, is very troubled himself. He doesn&rsquo;t know what to do and called the People&rsquo;s Paper to ask for help.Skhumbuzo &ndash; a qualified sangoma &ndash; told Daily Sun since 2014 he has had no peace because of baboons that visit his place.They come at night and terrorise him by making horrible sounds. He said the baboons are fighting him and they bring evil spirits into his yard. &ldquo;When this evil arrives at night the windows start to shake. The baboons are in the yard for most of the night and then leave in the morning.&rdquo;Skhumbuzo said his home is no longer a place of peace, and he feels bullied in his own yard.&ldquo;I feel they bring evil spirits and bad luck to me and my family. &ldquo;Even my brothers can&rsquo;t live with me because of them and my friends do not come to visit anymore.&ldquo;I stay in a shack while my neighbours have houses.&rdquo;Skhumbuzo appealed to anyone who can help him to chase away the baboons.&ldquo;I have checked my bones on many occasions and they confirm that they&rsquo;re evil, but do not give me a solution. I really need help before this evil totally ruins my life and the lives of my loved ones.&rdquo;
