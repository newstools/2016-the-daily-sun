The ANC's National Disciplinary Committee has found ANC Western Cape provincial chairperson Marius Fransman guilty on two counts of misconduct and has suspended his ANC membership for five years. The two counts of misconduct related to "abusing his office for the purpose of attempting to obtain a sexual favour from Louisa Wynand, and for making public statements which brought the ANC into disrepute", the ANC said in a statement on Thursday. "The NDC found both charges to be very serious and suspended his ANC membership for 5 years."Fransman did not attend his disciplinary hearing and "showed no remorse for his misconduct". The ANC said as a provincial leader, Fransman should have known about the oppression of women and the strides being made by ANC to accord women their rights. Fransman "showed no political understanding of one of the fundamental objectives of the ANC... the support for and advancement of women&rsquo;s emancipation". He also deliberately misled the public when he said he had not received documents to help him prepare for his disciplinary hearing, but "in truth, he was given all the relevant documents he needed to prepare his defence", the ANC said."Discipline is the glue that holds the ANC together. There is no room in the ANC for leaders and members, irrespective of position or seniority, who show scant regard for the values and objectives of the ANC and who consciously choose to define themselves outside the organisation in breach of their membership oath," the ANC said.&nbsp;
