INDEPENDENT Police Investigative Directorate head Robert McBride and two colleagues will appear in the Pretoria Magistrate&rsquo;s Court today on charges of fraud and defeating the ends of justice.McBride, Matthew Sesoko, and Innocent Khuba are being investigated by the Hawks' Crimes Against the State (Cats) unit.Charges against the trio relate to their investigation of former Hawks head, Lieutenant General Anwa Dramat.Dramat was accused of involvement in the illegal rendition of Zimbabwean nationals in 2010.An illegal rendition is transferring a foreign national in detention back to his or her country, knowing that person may be detained or interrogated by the foreign government.The findings contained in the last report on the matter, and which McBride signed, found Dramat and colleagues innocent of illegal renditions.However, McBride has been accused of changing an earlier report which implicated Dramat in the renditions.According to a report by law firm Werksmans Attorneys, portions of statements by individuals who implicated Dramat in the illegal renditions and which appeared in the first report, were left out of the second report.McBride has maintained that the earlier report did not take all the facts into account. &nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/mcbride-to-face-fraud-charge-20161101
