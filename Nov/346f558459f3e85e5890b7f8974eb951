KZN MEC for community safety Mxolisi Kaunda has called on cops to maintain a strong presence in Madulini, northern KZN. This is after a man and a woman were burnt to death on Saturday night. Kaunda said this was an apparent revenge attack after their relative stabbed a man to death at a traditional ceremony in September.The MEC pleaded with the families of the victims to allow the law to run its course.He said the attackers allegedly locked the man and the woman inside a hut before setting it alight. KZN cop spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said Nyanyekile Gumede and Sifiso Nkosi were burnt to death in their hut just before midnight.He said two more huts in the family&rsquo;s yard were also set ablaze. &ldquo;Three other family members were also burnt, but managed to escape into the nearby bush during the alleged revenge attack.&rdquo; He added cops made a breakthrough just a few hours after the fiery attack. They arrested five suspects, including a traditional healer, on Sunday.Two of the suspect were already trying to flee from the area.&ldquo;Police officers worked tirelessly to find the suspects. &ldquo;Their hard work paid off. &ldquo;Two of the suspects were arrested along the N2. &ldquo;They were on their way to Durban,&rdquo; said Zwane.He added all five suspects, aged between 22 and 32, have been charged with arson, two counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder. Zwane said all the suspects are neighbours of the victims. Acting provincial commissioner Major-General Bheki Langa condemned the attack. &ldquo;I would like to praise the officers who did not rest until they found the suspects and brought them to book. &ldquo;Police will conduct a thorough investigation and make sure those who are responsible for these crimes are convicted.&rdquo;
