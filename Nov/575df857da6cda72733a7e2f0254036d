MADALA Mzwandile Malumbezo said the ANC government destroyed his life. The 60-year-old from NU10 in Motherwell, Port Elizabeth, curses the day he voted for the democratic government.&ldquo;Democracy cost me my job, house and marriage,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Where is the better life that we were promised? SA&rsquo;s weak economy is the reason I lost my job in 2009. My boss told me I was retrenched because of a weak rand. &ldquo;The sheriffs kicked me out of my house after I failed to pay my bond. But it did not end there! My wife divorced me because I was unable to take care of my family.&rdquo; On top of this, the madala said he has been applying for RDP house since 2009 without luck. &ldquo;Housing officials keep telling me that my application hasn&rsquo;t been approved. I rent a backyard shack for R200 with money from my old age grant. The people we voted for drive expensive cars and live huge mansions,&rdquo; he said.Department of Human Settlements spokesman Lwandile Sicwetsha did not mince his words.&ldquo;Low-cost housing is meant for people who earn less than R3 500 and those who&rsquo;ve never owned a house. If he previously owned a house, he doesn&rsquo;t qualify,&rdquo; he said.
