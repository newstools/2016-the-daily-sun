DENIS Khoba is angry that the men who allegedly stabbed his son to death while he watched are still walking free. The dad (45) from Mohlakeng, Mogale City said he couldn&rsquo;t believe that people could be so cruel. Speaking about the incident that happened at the weekend, Denis said: &ldquo;If my son Thabang had done something wrong they could have taken him to the cops. &ldquo;I first saw them as I was walking down the street. They were coming towards my house carrying sjamboks and knives, but I didn&rsquo;t suspect they were hunting for my son. I just walked past them.&rdquo;But when Denis arrived home he heard people screaming. &ldquo;I saw four men attacking Thabang outside my house. I tried to rescue him but they assaulted me and I fell to the ground. &ldquo;I then saw Thabang bleeding heavily and running to the house, but he fell before he could reach the door and died. I&rsquo;m so traumatised by what I saw.&rdquo; Thabang&rsquo;s mum, Dipuo Mohanoe (41), said she was on her way home when she met the men on the street. &ldquo;They told me they had killed my son and I should go and bury him. When I arrived home my husband told me what had happened.&rdquo; Captain Ernst Apple confirmed a case of murder was opened.
