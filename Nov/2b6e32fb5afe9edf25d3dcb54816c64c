WHEN Pretoria Girls High School pupils protested against the school&rsquo;s hair policy back in August, one of the girls said she was instructed to fix her hair &ndash; as if there was something wrong with it. Now a group of four guys called Broken Society from Lwandle in Strand have drawn inspiration from those girls and are using photography and videos to express their opinions on issues affecting black communities.&ldquo;It is a movement to address social issues and stereotypes in our black communities and try to bring together our rainbow nation through pictures and videos,&rdquo; said co-founder Thabang Nkhahle (19).Thabang said the movement&rsquo;s aim is not to divide people, but to unite them.&ldquo;The more people know which challenges face different races, they will change the way they look at a particular race. The group recently held a photo shoot where people were asked to reveal their thoughts through placards and show pride in their natural hair. Vuyani Ralawe (21), another co-founder of the group, said the shoot was for everyone who wanted to make a statement.&ldquo;We have youth who have so much to say but they don&rsquo;t have a platform to express their views. We just provided them with that platform,&rdquo; said Vuyani.Silindokuhle Mtsako (18) said she went to Model C schools and her natural hair was criticised. &ldquo;I was judged because of my hair. I entered primary school with dreadlocks, but I decided to take them off because of peer pressure. So I grew my natural hair but to use chemicals to fit in at school.&rdquo; The group also plans to make a documentary in which people can speak out about issues that affect them.
