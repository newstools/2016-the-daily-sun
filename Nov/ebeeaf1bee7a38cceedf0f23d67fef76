SUSPENDED Bafana Bafana coach, Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba has been advised to apologise to Safa for his behaviour, as he stands accused of having wagged a finger at president Danny Jordaan.Mashaba will appear before the association&rsquo;s two-day disciplinary committee (DC) hearing at Safa House on 1 December and is expected to plead guilty to at least some of the charges.SunSport&rsquo;s informant says there is no turning back for Safa, who has had &ldquo;running battles&rsquo; with Mashaba up until the day Bafana beat Senegal 2-1 in a 2018 Fifa World Cup qualifier in Limpopo. &ldquo;The charges are so many that I don&rsquo;t see this case finishing in a day,&rdquo; said the source.&ldquo;It could actually turn into a three-day hearing but the legal team has finalised matters to get it done in two days. It is upsetting to be in this kind of position with Mashaba. The association expected a lot from him.&ldquo;I am told that his legal team wants him to accept the charge of having had running battles with the media and wagging a finger at his superiors.&ldquo;But from Safa&rsquo;s side I understand there is no turning back. The people in charge just want to settle this matter without getting their fingers burned.&rdquo;As SunSport understands it, no one from Safa House is allowed to talk about the matter until the case has been heard.
