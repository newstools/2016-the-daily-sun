SPEAK out about abuse of women and children!This was the call from former SA soccer ace Benni McCarthy, when he broke down at a press conference yesterday and disclosed that he comes from a family with an abusive father. He`told reporters that growing up in Hanover Park outside Cape Town he was surrounded by crime, gang life, murder and abuse. Benni recalled how he had to witness his late dad abusing his mum. It could so easily have impacted negatively on his life, yet he chose to prove to his father that he was better than him &ndash; and he is now a proud father of four beautiful little girls.Benni spoke out about his abusive past after announcing that he will be joining the fight against child abuse, and supporting the child rights group Women and Men Against Child Abuse. Benni said as a father he knew that nothing was more important than the safety of children.Vincentia Dlamini, director of the rights group, congratulated Benni on speaking out.&ldquo;Benni&rsquo;s willingness to stand up and speak out on the subject sets an example to society that if we are going to tackle abuse, we are going to have to be willing to acknowledge its impact and talk about how we bring it to an end. &ldquo;Too many people and communities would rather stay silent, and I know that Benni&rsquo;s example will help change that.&ldquo;In just a year, we have assisted in over 1 896 new cases of child abuse through our Kidz Clinics,&rdquo; said Dlamini.Women and Men Against Child Abuse is a 19-year-old non-governmental organisation providing free help to victims of child abuse in Mzansi through Kidz Clinics in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni and Alexandra, north of Joburg.The organisation also fight for better rights for survivors, proper sentences for abusers and raises public awareness of the terrible impact these crimes have on individuals, communities and society. Friday marked the beginning of the international 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children campaign.
