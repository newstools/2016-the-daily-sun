THE school is known for producing quality results.But this could come to an end, as divisions among parents, pupils and the school&rsquo;s governing body threaten to tear the school apart.On Monday, angry parents demanded the removal of an English teacher from Lwamondo High School in Lwamondo, near Thohoyandou. They accused him of being a drunkard and neglecting his duties.However, the pupils were shocked by what their parents were doing.They vowed to fight for the teacher, who they said is doing a good job.The trouble started in March when the teacher was accused of leaving the school early to drink at a nearby tavern. Patrick Mathidi, chairman of the school&rsquo;s governing body, said they have done all in their power to address the issue. He said: &ldquo;This is a recipe for disaster. &ldquo;Our children are no longer being taught English.&ldquo;They are uncontrollable because there is no one to supervise them in class.&rdquo;Pfariso Sibei, a pupil, disagreed with the calls to have the teacher fired.&ldquo;We are the ones who are supposed to complain if he is not doing his job. &ldquo;He is a hard worker and we were passing his subject. &ldquo;He is not going anywhere.&rdquo; Limpopo Education spokesman Dr Naledzani Rasila said the department will conduct an investigation into the matter.Once they have established the facts, they will decide what course of action to take.
