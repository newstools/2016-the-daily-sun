Orlando Pirates interim coach Augusto Palacios is seemingly keeping red-hot striker Tendai Ndoro grounded by reminding the Zimbabwe international that he has coached other top class strikers including Benni McCarthy and Lesley Manyathela.The forward has nine goals in nine games for the Buccaneers in the Premiership this season, and has 20 goals to his name in all competitions since the start of 2016.In addition, he is currently the top-scoring player in the country for the calendar year, and has netted 90% of the club's goals in 2016/17.However, Palacios has been quick to remind the 28-year-old that he is experienced in working with top class strikers and can not take his good form for granted.Ahead of Bucs' Telkom Knockout semi-final clash with SuperSport United on Saturday, he told reporters: "It's an honour for me to work with Ndoro but I have worked with the best at Pirates like Benni, Manyathela and many more."But, I'm proud of Ndoro that he is taking the responsibility to score for the team, it is good for his career and reputation."
