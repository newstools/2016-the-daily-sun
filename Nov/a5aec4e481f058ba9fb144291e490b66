BIDVEST Wits coach Gavin Hunt has set his sights on following in the footsteps of reigning Caf Champions League champions Mamelodi Sundowns.The Clever Boys mentor told the media after his side beat Chippa United 1-0 in an Absa Premiership game on Tuesday that he would be happy to win the continental trophy.He said: &ldquo;I have always wanted to do well in the Champions League. We will try to challenge for it on all fronts but it does matter who you play. We will give it a go. Obviously the prestige is more important than any fortune you make from it.&rdquo; Hunt reckons he has assembled a strong squad capable of making a serious challenge for the trophy that Downs won almost 21 years after Orlando Pirates had done so in 1995.He added: &ldquo;I feel we&rsquo;ve got a good squad to go there and compete. I have put in good teams in the past and we were not good enough, we got knocked out. &ldquo;Now our squad is better and I can box clever.&rdquo; Hunt stressed that his charges&rsquo; unbeaten run in the league had not put them under any pressure, but inspired them to keep doubling their efforts.He continued: &ldquo;There is no pressure because we don&rsquo;t really look at our position. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still early days &ndash; you&rsquo;ve got Sundowns who have played only two games, we&rsquo;ve played six and other teams have played seven. &ldquo;I think once Sundowns catch up we will be more keen than they are. I think this group of players haven&rsquo;t reached their potential yet.&rdquo; Hunt reckons the return of speedy winger Phakamani Mahlambi and striker James Keen from injury will help them as they mount a challenge for the title. &ldquo;We are pretty strong, and with Keen and Mahlambi coming back I think we will be even stronger,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Mahlambi will be ready to play in February. I can get him back late in December and give him at least 20 minutes. &ldquo;Last season the main reason we lost the league is because we lost him, Faty Papy and Tyson (Thulani Hlatshwayo) with eight games to go. If we keep those ones fit, we&rsquo;re certain to do better.&rdquo;
