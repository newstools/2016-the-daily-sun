HIGHLANDS PARK reserves are determined to continue where they left of before the long break in the MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC).The Lions of the North will be hosting inconsistent Kaizer Chiefs today at Makhulong Stadium, Tembisa (at noon).This is their first season playing in the MDC, but Highlands have responded well in the past five games that have been played so far. Chiefs have won three, drew one and lost one match in the reserve league.Highlands have done better than other teams who have been campaigning in the MDC for the past two seasons.Highlands coach, Les Grobler, said despite winning four out of the five games, there&rsquo;s still room for improvement.Highlands have collected 13 points, having won four and drew one match, they are yet to lose a match on their first season.Said Grobler: &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t been an easy journey, but players have shown character and fighting spirit.&ldquo;Looking at the games we played, we came from behind to win all of them. That shows we still need to put some work in our defence, we can&rsquo;t be conceding goals in each and every game.&rdquo;The former Moroka Swallows striker downplayed that they would love to win this competition that comes with a week trip to the Netherlands.&ldquo;Winning the MDC is not our main focus. We&rsquo;re not focusing highly on being at the top. To us it&rsquo;s more about developing players,&rdquo; he said.
