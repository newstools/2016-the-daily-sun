ANGRY parent Angie Makgalathibe wants her son back at school. The 40-year-old from Refilwe, in Tshwane, told Daily Sun her child and 20 other kids were suspended for failing to pay R2 to wear normal clothes to school two weeks ago. Angie said Sedibeng Primary School sent out letters to the parents telling them to attend a hearing on Wednesday. &ldquo;The letter said my son bunks classes and that he&rsquo;s disrespectful. But I don&rsquo;t believe that because I heard the other parents received exactly the same letter.&rdquo; Angie said other pupils were told the kids were suspended for not paying the R2. &ldquo;I gave my son the money and told him to hand it over to his teacher but the teacher denies receiving it.&rdquo; Angie said it wasn&rsquo;t the first time pupils had been suspended for no reason.&ldquo;On another occasion a teacher swore at pupils and when they reported the matter to the principal, they were suspended for supposedly being disrespectful.&rdquo; &ldquo;I worry about the role of the SGB because when we raise concerns with them they ignore us.&rdquo; Gauteng Education acting spokesman Oupa Bodibe said it was unlawful for a school to suspend pupils over unpaid money.&ldquo;We would like to indicate to parents that it&rsquo;s not compulsory to pay money for children to wear civvies. It&rsquo;s a donation.&rdquo; But he said the department had been to the school and established that pupils were suspended &shy;because they had been disrespectful to their teachers.
