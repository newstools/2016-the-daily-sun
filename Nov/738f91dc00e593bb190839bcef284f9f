BOYS from this village swim in the nearby river nearly every day but their elders are worried about whether the water is clean.Eleven boys aged 7&ndash;15 were infected by bilharzia after swimming in the Levubu River near Mhinga Village outside Malamulele.The boys have been receiving medical treatment but local kids continue to play in the water. Over the weekend, the SunTeam spoke to boys swimming in the river. Amukelani Chauke (10) said: &ldquo;We are forced to come to the river and swim because it&rsquo;s very hot here. Sometimes we have to wash our clothes here too because the village often goes for months with dry taps.&rdquo;Asked about the bilharzia, he said: &ldquo;About a week ago, my friends and I swam in the river and when I went home I saw I was peeing blood. My mum took me to the clinic and nurses said I had bilharzia.&rdquo; He said he was given medication but when the bleeding stopped, he returned.Bilharzia can damage a person&rsquo;s kidneys and in severe cases, can cause death. Musa Maluleke (9), who also has been infected, said: &ldquo;This disease has become so common in our village. I was infected in October and again a week ago. &ldquo;We are no longer scared of getting it.&rdquo; A local clinic nurse told Daily Sun each day about six kids from Mhinga and Madandila villages are treated for the disease. Health spokesman Derick Kganyago said most rivers in the province have bilharzia.
