DISGRACED former Ukhozi FM DJ, Linda &ldquo;Mr Magic&rdquo; Sibiya, is said to be at it again.The radio man, who recently quit Vuma FM on allegations that he was going to start his own online radio station, is said to have asked businessman Martin Lentsoane to lend him R100 000.Sources said Linda promised to pay back the money on 25 October.&ldquo;But Martin only gave him R10 000 because he didn&rsquo;t trust him,&rdquo; said a source.One source close to the two former friends said Mr Magic said the DJ didn&rsquo;t stick to his promise of paying on 25 October.Instead the Magic Communications owner allegedly sent a message to Martin, telling him to stop sending his lawyer asking for money because he was planning on paying it back.The source added: &ldquo;Martin was reluctant to give him R100 000 because he was new to him.&ldquo;The two met at a party of another businessman in Durban, where they&rsquo;re said to have exchanged contacts.&ldquo;We overheard Martin saying this guy was a fraudster, not the man of God he portrays himself to be in public.&rdquo;Sunday Sun is in possession of the alleged message that was sent to Martin by Linda, asking him to tell his lawyer to stop talking about the debt.Another source claimed what irritated Martin was the fact that Mr Magic was rude to him when he asked for his money back.Said the second source: &ldquo;Martin hates the fact that they go around acting as if they&rsquo;re God-fearing people. &ldquo;They pretend to be worshippers of God and motivational speakers, yet they&rsquo;re doing the opposite.&rdquo;The source further claimed that Linda is currently squatting in Dainfern, in Fourways, north of Jozi, in the same apartment that was paid for by Martin.When Martin was contacted for comment, he confirmed giving Linda R10 000, but declined to comment further because the matter was now with his lawyers.When called for comment, Linda said Martin&rsquo;s been paid but didn&rsquo;t say when. He told the Peoples Paper: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve paid Martin his R10 000.&rdquo;
