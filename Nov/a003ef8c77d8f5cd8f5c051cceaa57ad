I have more than 180 appointments.&ldquo;I have cut three boys from Cape Town, Joburg and Pretoria and I have received inquiries from Kimberley and Bloemfontein. &ldquo;Among the boys I have circumcised was one from King William&rsquo;s Town. He stayed for two weeks at my school and his parents took him yesterday. He has healed but will spend his last week at a school near his home.&rdquo;He said on Saturday he cut over 50 boys in Addo, Wesley Estate, Motherwell, Kamvelihle, Red House, KwaMgxaki and Goven Mbeki. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting on boys from troubled areas like Libobe and Lusikisiki to arrive,&rdquo; he said.Damase said he was supported by ingcibi Zukile &ldquo;Snake&rdquo; Bangani.Pastor Mxolisi Noyila from Joe Slovo said: &ldquo;I brought my son and grandson to Snake.
