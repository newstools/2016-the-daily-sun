THE two women were tenants in the same yard and were fighting over a man.The one woman stabbed the other to death. She was arrested and the court granted her bail.But then the suspect disappeared, until cops bust her again on Tuesday, after she&rsquo;d been hiding for nine years.Police said they had looked all over Kagiso and as far as Hekpoort on the West Rand after the murder in 2007.Police spokesman Captain Solomon Sibiya said: &ldquo;The suspect apparently had a heated argument with another woman. &ldquo;Neighbours told officers the argument over a man soon became a serious brawl that ended when the suspect drew a knife.&ldquo;Neighbours said the suspect stabbed the other woman in the upper body. &ldquo;She was rushed to hospital but was certified dead on arrival.&rdquo; He said the suspect was arrested and detained at Kagiso cop shop, where she was charged with murder. She later appeared in the Kagiso Magistrates Court and was granted bail and told to be back the next week, but she vanished.&ldquo;The court issued a warrant of arrest when she failed to appear,&rdquo; said Sibiya.Then earlier this month, one lead led to another and police traced the suspect to Zeerust in North West, hundreds of kilometres from the crime scene. &ldquo;Detective-Warrant Officer Mshiyeni Ngcobo and Detective-Constable Slatuwani Muthala drove to North West and located the suspect. &ldquo;She was found relaxing at home.&ldquo;Police arrested her and brought her back to Kagiso cop shop for detention.&rdquo; The suspect appeared yesterday in the Kagiso Magistrates Court.
