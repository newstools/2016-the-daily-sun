IT WAS like a scene from a soapie. The gogo from Mohlaletsi Village outside Jane Furse, Limpopo, was allegedly attacked by her kids after she refused to give them their younger sister&rsquo;s lobola money.The gogo said her kids demanded that she gives them money for petrol before leaving for Gauteng a day after the wedding. She said she offered them the R200 she had on her but that&rsquo;s when they demanded the lobola money.&ldquo;I refused but as I turned my back on them, one kicked me and I fell to the ground, and the other strangled me,&rdquo; gogo said.According to the gogo, one of her twin sons assaulted her while she was lying on the ground, while the other son went to her bedroom and ripped out the safe and took the money.The gogo said their sister and brother were watching. &ldquo;The twins took the money and left,&rdquo; she said. One of gogo&rsquo;s older sons said he tried to stop his siblings from assaulting their mother.&ldquo;I think the life in Gauteng has changed them. They don&rsquo;t have respect for their tradition any more,&rdquo; he said.A case of robbery and assault was opened at Masenkaneng cop shop, but was later withdrawn after the gogo&rsquo;s sons came back and apologised. Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said: &ldquo;The complainant submitted a withdrawal statement. The case was referred to the local public prosecutor for a decision.&rdquo;
