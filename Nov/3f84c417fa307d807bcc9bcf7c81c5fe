KAIZER Chiefs coach Steve Komphela is skating on thin ice as his charges failed to win their sixth successive match when they were held to a 1-1 draw by Cape Town City in an Absa Premiership match at FNB Stadium last night.However, this was a fairytale run for City who regained their position at the top of table with 20 points from 11 games, while Chiefs have collected 17 points from 11 matches.Komphela came into the match under severe pressure to appease unruly Chiefs fans who throwed objects into him after the game demanding his resignation.The former Bafana Bafana captain continued with the chopping and changing of his starting line-up as he made two changes to the side that drew 1-1 against SuperSport United in their last league game at the same venue. He only had the same starting line-up twice in 11 outings.He brought in Daniel Cardoso for the injured Erick Mathoho, while defender Sibusiso Khumalo replaced Tsepo Masilela.However, Khumalo only lasted on the pitch for 28th minutes as he was given a red card for a tackle on Thamsanqa Mkhize. However, referee Victor Gomes was a bit harsh as Khumalo didn&rsquo;t show his studs when he went for the challenge. Gomes was in mean mood as he also sent-off the ball boy for time wasting on the stroke of full time.Komphela has also been using a different formation in the past four games, 3-4-3 and 4-5-1 but this time he opted for a 4-4-1-1 hoping to get a winning formula.City were hoping to continue with their fairytale run which saw them secure a date with SuperSport in the Telkom Knockout final on 10 December. The Cape Town side also surprised a lot of people, including the so-called football experts as they are among the early pace setters instead of being involved in the relegation zone.Chiefs had a positive start using the width of the pitch to launch their attacks. Their persistent play paid-off as early as the fourth minute when George Maluleka&rsquo;s shot deflected off Michelle Katzvairo into the net from Siphiwe Tshabalala&rsquo;s free kick.City came back strong after the break following a halftime pep-talk from coach Eric Tinkler. They camped in Chiefs half and got rewarded in the 53rd minutes when substitute midfielder Mathew Sim grabbed the equaliser with a thunderous shot that deflected off Lorenzo Gordinho to beat a bemused Itumeleng Khune.Amakhosi woes worsened in the 67th minutes when Khune was replaced by Brilliant Khuzwayo after he sustained a back injury as he landed awkwardly after he saved Lehlohonolo Majoro&rsquo;s shot.
