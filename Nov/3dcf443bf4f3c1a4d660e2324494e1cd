SARS has called on its staff members and all other South Africans to report racist incidents, after a watershed ruling yesterday by the Constitutional Court.The ConCourt ruled that it was unreasonable for Sars to reinstate an employee who was dismissed in 2007 for using the k-word.Sars said: &ldquo;We welcome the Constitutional Court&rsquo;s ruling in its favour with regard to its decision to dismiss Jacobus Kruger for calling his supervisor the k-word.&rdquo; &ldquo;We see this as a victory for creating a non-racial society and encourage citizens and staff to report all incidents of racism.&rdquo;In a unanimous judgment which was written by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, the court highlighted the seriousness of the use of the k-word and described it as a very shocking, derogatory and humiliating expression.
