AFTER his wife died, a 42-year-old dad allegedly turned to his daughter to meet his sexual needs! The monster dad reportedly had sex with his teenage daughter every day until she fell pregnant and then he took the girl for a backstreet abortion. The 16-year-old from Gugulethu squatter camp in Springs, Ekurhuleni, said her father threatened to hurt her if she told anyone what was going on, but last week, she realised she couldn&rsquo;t protect him any more. She told a classmate about her horrific home life and the friend approached a teacher. The teacher reported the matter to the principal, who went to the cops on Monday. The principal told the father to meet him at the school and when he arrived, the cops pounced. He was arrested and charged with rape and organising an illegal abortion. The girl was taken to a place of safety. Shocked neighbours told the SunTeam they didn&rsquo;t know about the dad&rsquo;s evil deeds. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;d known we wouldn&rsquo;t have allowed him to live among us. He&rsquo;s an animal. How can a father treat his own child like that? He must rot in jail,&rdquo; said one resident. Another community member said: &ldquo;There are many women looking for men. He could have picked anyone but because he&rsquo;s a coward, he chose to sleep with his own daughter.&rdquo; Springs police spokesman Captain Johannes Ramphora confirmed the incident.&ldquo;We commend the principal and teacher. What happened to the girl is unacceptable and the law will take its course. We appeal to other girls in the same situation to tell someone and not to suffer in silence.&rdquo;
