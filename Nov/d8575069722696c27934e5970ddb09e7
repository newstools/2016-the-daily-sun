Suprise Premiership high-flyers Cape Town City will reportedly split R2 million amongst the players if the team wins the Telkom Knockout trophy. The Citizens, who currently occupy second place in the PSL after a run of four wins in a row, have been incentivised to beat Free State Stars at Athlone Stadium in Saturday's semi-final.However, it is not expected to be easy for the Eric Tinkler-coached outfit as they go into the contest without first choice central defensive pairing, Tsepo Gumede and Robyn Johannes, who are suspended.Nonetheless, Tinkler has revealed that his players will have an added financial motivation to go on to win the final as the squad will collect half of the R4 million prize money.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He told reporters ahead of the clash, "The incentive is there&sbquo; half the prize money is theirs."&nbsp;Saturday's action gets underway from 14:00 in the Mother City.
