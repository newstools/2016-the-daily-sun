BAFANA Bafana thumped Senegal 2-1 to climb on top of Group D in the 2018 Russia World Cup Qualifiers at Peter Mokaba stadium on Saturday. Bafana have four points after two games. They played to a 1-all draw against Burkina Faso in their opener.Shakes Mashaba, who was under pressure to get that much-needed win, fielded an attacking starting eleven, relying on Mpho Makola, Thulani Serero, Keagan Dolly and Eleazar Rodgers to do the job for him at the fore front. Mmaelodi Sundowns midfielder Tiyani Mabunda, who was called in to join the squad on Wednesday to replace injured Dean Furman started the game and was paired with Andile Jali in the middle of the park.Despite the game starting on a slow pace, with both teams lacking to create chances at goal, it was only in the last few minutes of the first half when Bafana scored two quick goals.Bafana broke the ice through Thulani Hlatshwayo&rsquo;s penalty before Man of the Match Thulani Serero doubled the score for the home side. The penalty was awarded following Rodgers goal bound header was stopped with a hand. The&nbsp;Lions of Teranga &nbsp;boast amazing talent in their squad who ply their trade in the English Premiership, such as Stoke City&rsquo;s Mame Biram Diouf, Sadio Mane of Liverpool, Everton&rsquo;s Idrissa Gueye and West Ham United star Cheikhou Kouyate but Itumeleng Khune and his defense were fully prepared for them.Mashaba charges continued from where they left in the first stanza by creating goal scoring chances, however, Senegal coach Aliou Ciss made a substitution early in the second half and his side looked more casual in the ball, giving Bafana trouble at the back. Seeking to bounce back into the game, Senegal launched a counter-attack and a mistake from Bafana at the back gave the visiting side &nbsp;a chance to score but it was too late for them to steal a point from Bafana.&nbsp;
