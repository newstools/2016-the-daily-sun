TEACHERS at Mzamowethu Public School are sick and tired of their pupils&rsquo; place of learning being targeted by thugs. They said thieves have repeatedly stolen from the school in Gonubie, Buffalo City. Deputy principal Malibongwe Mangxola said the thefts started over the September school holidays and continued since the school opened. He said the thieves started at the pre-school where they took a burglar door, toys, mats and other things. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how someone could steal toys and mats for kids,&rdquo; he said. He said the thieves later returned for the microwave, rugby balls, burglar gates and doors. They also broke into the head of department&rsquo;s office and took shoes, a jacket and groceries. A teacher said the thieves meant business when they broke into the computer room and took five computers. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why they&rsquo;re doing this because it&rsquo;s the only school in the township.&rdquo; The thefts have particularly affected matrics, who have been staying at the school to study for their final exams. SGB member Boy Boy Kalani said parents were working with the SGB and teachers to stop the break-ins.&ldquo;We have already started searching each house in the township to see if we can find the stolen goods.&rdquo; He said people who stole were usually known by residents and they were hoping everyone would work together to recover the stolen property. Police spokeswoman Warrant Officer Hazel Mqala said the police had made arrests and recovered some of the stolen items.
