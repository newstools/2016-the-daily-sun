COMMUTERS experienced the taxi ride from hell on Friday after they were held hostage by four armed men. Kabelo Matlou (27) told Daily Sun he was lucky to be alive after witnessing the driver being killed in cold blood. &ldquo;When I knocked off work, I went to the taxi rank in Sandton, north of Joburg, to catch a late taxi. I was the last passenger to get on and I thought I was lucky, but it turned out to be very bad luck.&ldquo;Without warning, two men pulled out guns and demanded the driver take them to Malibongwe Drive. One of the men was sitting in the front of the taxi and it was clear they had planned everything. They obviously knew the driver as one of the men asked him &lsquo;remember me, homeboy&rsquo; before shooting him twice. &ldquo;After the driver was shot, I tried to jump out of the taxi but they pulled me back in and told me I would be next to die if I did something stupid.&rdquo; Kabelo said the driver died instantly and his body was thrown out of the moving vehicle. One of the men sitting in the front seat started driving and they ended up in a field in Cosmo City. The thugs then robbed the passengers of all their belongings before fleeing the scene. Honeydew police spokeswoman Captain Lydia Dikolomela confirmed the incident. &ldquo;Police were with the family of the victim to identify his body. &ldquo;No arrests have been made but we are looking for the suspects. &ldquo;Anyone with information about their whereabouts or who has any information about the incident should contact us on 072 124 3704.&rdquo;
