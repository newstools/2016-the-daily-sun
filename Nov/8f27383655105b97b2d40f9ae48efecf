FALSE lashes are great for making the eyes pop and adding dramatic flair to one&rsquo;s costume or outfit &ndash; but they can also be a nightmare to apply and remove.&nbsp; Whether one prefers temporary strip lashes or individual permanent lashes, there are necessary safety measures you need to take.&nbsp; - Eyelashes need to be done by a reputable professional with the use of high-quality products. Any allergic reactions could cause loss of natural lashes, eye damage and can sometimes cause loss of sight.&nbsp; - To avoid any irritation, do a patch test to determine any allergies beforehand.&nbsp; - Natural eyelashes protect the eyes from dust, sweat and any foreign materials.&nbsp;False lashes tend to trap dirt and bacteria.&nbsp;Consulting with a professional to get the best results and maintain high standards is important.&nbsp; - False strip lashes are also great for temporary use, but should not be kept on for too long or more than 48 hours.&nbsp; - If you love lash extensions, make sure you take the necessary breaks to avoid your natural lashes from being permanently damaged or infected.&nbsp; - The best way to remove fake lashes is to use a special remover to soften the glue.&nbsp;Aggressively or incorrectly removing the lashes could cost you your natural eyelashes.&nbsp;
