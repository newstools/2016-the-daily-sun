AFTER playing only his second match this season, Golden Arrows captain Matome Mathiane claims his confidence has returned. Mathiane didn&rsquo;t play any part in Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende&rsquo;s first eight matches of the season. His first match was the 1-0 away win against Highlands Park two weeks ago. And then, against Mamelodi Sundowns last Wednesday, the skipper had a game he would prefer to forget. Mathiane and his goalkeeper, Maximilian Mbaeva, were exposed by the quick Sundowns forwards and Arrows conceded three goals for the second time this season, ultimately losing 3-0 to the defending Absa Premiership champions.Still, Mathiane believes he has done well enough in his first two matches to have earned himself another run against Polokwane City at the King Zwelithini Stadium tomorrow (7.30pm). &ldquo;My confidence is back and I&rsquo;m looking forward to playing against Polokwane. In fact, everyone is looking forward to that game. We are coming from a defeat and want to turn things around. &ldquo;We are playing at home, so we have to win,&rdquo; he said.Arrows go into this match without their midfield strongman Danny Phiri, who was red-carded against Sundowns. Mathiane reckons Nkanyiso Cele could be the one to fill his shoes. &ldquo;Nkanyiso has been competing with Phiri in that position. I think he&rsquo;s the one to get a run now that Phiri is out.&rdquo;The skipper said he understood the danger posed by City, who won their most recent game against Free State Stars. &ldquo;They have a point to prove against us, especially their players Rodney Ramagalela and Edgar Manaka, who played for us last season. I&rsquo;m sure they would like to put one over on us. They are dangerous but luckily we know them very well,&rdquo; he added. Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende fans will have something else to smile about ahead of this game, with the news that Kagisho Dikgacoi and Nkayiso Mngwengwe are both back from suspension in time for the clash.
