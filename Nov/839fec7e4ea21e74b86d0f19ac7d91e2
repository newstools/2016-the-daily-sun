HERBALIFE has been found guilty of operating &ldquo;unfairly&rdquo; and ripping off its 1,9 million salespeople around the world.According to The Guardian, the dieting supplement sales company had been accused of operating a &ldquo;pyramid scheme&rdquo;, cheating low-income people who thought they could make a living selling the products out of their money.A pyramid scheme is a company that operates by paying participants for recruiting more participants. The company then pays the early participants using the money contributed by the later participants. The model is unsustainable, and such companies often collapse. They are illegal in many countries.Herbalife, which was started 32 years ago, is based in Los Angeles, America. An activist called Bill Ackman accused the company in 2012 of conning millions of vulnerable people around the world out of their money.&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had millions of low-income people around the world who&rsquo;ve got their hopes up that there&rsquo;s an opportunity to become millionaires ... and they&rsquo;ve been duped,&rdquo; said Ackman.While allegedly cheating its salespeople, Herbalife&rsquo;s Michael Johnson was America&rsquo;s highest-paid CEO. Last year he earned $89 million (about R1,2 billion).The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in America investigated Herbalife. On Friday, it found that Herbalife had cheated its salespeople out of hundreds of millions of dollars.The FTC&rsquo;s chairwoman, Edith Ramirez, was reported as saying that a career selling Herbalife products was worthless. The only people who made any money out of Herbalife were those who aggressively recruited new people to pay $2 000 (about R27 000) for training and products.The company&rsquo;s business model was described as being &ldquo;unfair&rdquo;. It was fined $200 million (about R2,7 billion) by the FTC.Ackman is convinced the business will fail, according to The Guardian. For now, however, Herbalife lives on, although the value of its stock has been under pressure because of the &ldquo;pyramid scheme&rdquo; accusations.&nbsp;
