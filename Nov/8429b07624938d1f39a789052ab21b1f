THE red berets will descend on Bloemfontein today to support Julius Malema. The EFF leader will be in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court to face a second charge of disobeying the apartheid-era Riotous Assemblies Act. Last week Malema appeared in court in Newcastle, KZN for telling his followers to illegally occupy land there. His appearance today relates to a similar statement he made during the EFF&rsquo;s first elective conference in 2014. His lawyers have applied for the act to be declared unconstitutional and have filed papers with the High Court to indicate this. The EFF urged its members to gather in Bloemfontein for what they termed the trial of the revolution. Following his appearance in Newcastle last week, Malema added fuel to the fire by telling his followers the EFF was not calling for the slaughter of whites yet. &ldquo;We will take back the land and demand our identity back.&rdquo;He said real criminals like former president FW de Klerk had not appeared in court for stealing land. &ldquo;The journey is the defeat of white monopoly capital, the defeat of the Ruperts and Oppenheimers.&rdquo; Malema also called for an early national election to remove Zuma. He ended his address by singing, &ldquo;Kiss the boer, kiss the farmer&rdquo;.
