There are many ways to flatten a kota. Some like to press it against something flat like a table. Others like to stamp on it with their feet.Chef Dee used the unique approach of driving over it with her hardy red Land Cruiser. Not only does it save time, it&rsquo;s a lot of fun too!To make this Roadkill Kota, you will need:A car1 loaf white bread (not sliced)1 Russian, cut into slices500g ready-made slapchips 6 tablespoons mango achaMethod- With a sharp knife, cut out the bread from the middle of the loaf. Put aside.- Mix the slapchips, slices of Russian and acha in a bowl.- Stuff the hollowed out loaf with the slapchip, Russian and acha mixture.- Leave a little space to stuff the bread removed from the loaf back into it on top of the mixture.- Replace the top crust of the loaf over the hole at the top of the loaf.- Place kota in a sturdy plastic bag. Make sure there is little air trapped inside when you tie it so that the bag doesn&rsquo;t explode under the weight of the car.- Put the kota lengthwise under the front tyre of your car.- Turn your car on and slowly drive over it.- Remove squashed kota from under your car.- Cut the flattened loaf into pieces. Serve with a side salad.Enjoy!&nbsp;
