DJ BONGZ has allegedly been spinning a web of lies.That&rsquo;s because the popular DJ, real name Bongani Dlamini, has been accused of reaping where he hasn&rsquo;t sown.His latest hit, Eya Papu, was allegedly the product of riding roughshod over the little man.And two producers claiming credit for the song were angry for allegedly being sidelined from its wave of success.Based in Umlazi, south of Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, Mthoko &ldquo;Clinton Que&rdquo; Mbili (23) and S&rsquo;thembile &ldquo;Deejay Stera&rdquo; Mzilikazi (25) claimed DJ Bongz owed them.&ldquo;DJ Bongz took the beat from us in July. He then promised to pay us R4 000 by August. He also listed us for royalties,&rdquo; Clinton said.&ldquo;Royalties get paid once every three or six months, but we&rsquo;re waiting for that too.&ldquo;He should pay us our money and royalties.&rdquo;This week DJ Bongz said: &ldquo;I paid Stera for it and I don&rsquo;t have to provide any proof of payment to you.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deal with the other boy but I know the two of them made the beat.&rdquo;Deejay Stera said DJ Bongz still owes them money, but refused to comment further.
