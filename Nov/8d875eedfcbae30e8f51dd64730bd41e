She was killed by electrical wires in the street where she collected cans and bottles.Gogo Maria Sambo (56) of Grithan, near Komatipoort, was found dead in a web of wires on Sunday. Her daughter Betty Sambo (26) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;She kept saying if she didn&rsquo;t do something, we would die of hunger. She died trying to get money to buy food.&rdquo;Betty said her mum was happy to be collecting rubbish. But on Sunday morning Betty was woken by a call telling her Maria was dead. &ldquo;On Sunday we did not have food and she woke up early to collect waste to sell on Monday. We were shocked to hear she was killed by izinyoka wires.&rdquo;Million Thobela (47) said he saw her collecting cans and bottles. &ldquo;I saw her in the morning. The next thing she was lying on the ground. I called my neighbour and we rushed to the scene. She was tangled in the wires and it was raining. We could do nothing for her.&rdquo;Eskom spokesman Eric Khoza said they are investigating Maria&rsquo;s death, which was allegedly caused by an illegal connection. &ldquo;We regret this death as our aim is to improve South Africans&rsquo; standard of living,&rdquo; he said.
