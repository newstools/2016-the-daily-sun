WHAT was supposed to be a prayer session for rain yesterday turned into a defence of the ANC-led government. Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina used Pastor Mboro&rsquo;s Incredible Happenings church service in Katlehong to argue against the removal of the ANC&rsquo;s National Executive Committee. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t remove the sitting government by force. We go through elections,&rdquo; he said. Masina said people needed to wait for a change of leadership, as you couldn&rsquo;t just go against the democratic will of the people. &ldquo;Elections come in South Africa every five years. We don&rsquo;t obey calls made by influential business people who want to tell us what direction to take.&rdquo; Minister of Water and Sanitation Nomvula Mokonyane spoke about the struggles of various African countries to recover from regime change. &ldquo;The people of Tunisia fought for change in 2010, but now their country is collapsing. &ldquo;In Libya, there were strong voices calling for the removal of President Muammar Gaddafi. If you look at Libya then and Libya now, you can&rsquo;t recognise it.&rdquo; The minister also pleaded with people to use the little water available sparingly. &ldquo;We came here today because we need water to drink, to plant and for our animals. We need water to live. We came here to ask for prayers so God will help us.&rdquo;
