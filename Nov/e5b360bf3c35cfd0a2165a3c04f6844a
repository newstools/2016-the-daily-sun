STEVE Komphela is a frustrated man! Kaizer Chiefs strikers are not scoring &ndash; but at least the defenders and goalkeepers are not conceding either.For three matches on the trot, Amakhosi have played to goalless draws, something that is annoying the Chiefs head coach.They have a Telkom Knockout quarterfinal assignment against free-scoring Free State Stars at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Sunday, in the only cup match of the day at 3pm.The lack of sharpness Komphela&rsquo;s charges display in front of goal is a worrying factor. On Wednesday, Amakhosi were frustrated by Baroka FC and registered a 0-0 draw in their Absa Premiership match at the same stadium, which saw them surrender their top spot in the league table to Bidvest Wits. The dreary draws started in their match against Maritzburg United in the Telkom Knockout two weeks ago, which they ultimately won on penalties. Their second goalless draw was in the Soweto derby against Orlando Pirates last Saturday. Komphela said: &ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m happy my guys are not conceding goals. If you don&rsquo;t concede, you don&rsquo;t lose games. But you don&rsquo;t win matches if you don&rsquo;t score either. &ldquo;What worries me the most is that we are creating enough chances, we&rsquo;re just not capitalising on them. It&rsquo;s frustrating. &ldquo;Before the Pirates match we were scoring two goals per match. But it seems our tap has run dry. We need to start scoring again. &ldquo;We are happy with clean sheets but it is overshadowed by the fact that we&rsquo;ve been drawing and not winning.&rdquo; The former Bafana Bafana mentor is adamant that he will be able to remedy this situation against Ea Lla Koto. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been down this road before,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At the beginning of the season when results were not coming, it was frustrating but we managed to turn things around. We will bounce back and goals will come.&rdquo;Komphela reckons they have run out of luck: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know much about Stars this season, except that they can score goals. It was evident when they beat Wits to reach to this stage of the tournament. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need to be very careful.&rdquo;
