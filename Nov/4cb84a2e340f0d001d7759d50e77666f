A GROUP of women has been criticised for selling dirty mogodu to customers. The women from Tembisa in Ekurhuleni are accused of washing their meat in a dirty stream.The women told Daily Sun they used to clean the meat at their homes but their landlords got angry so they were forced to use the stream. When the SunTeam visited the stream, it was clearly dirty and rubbish could be seen floating in the water. However, the women insisted they didn&rsquo;t put the meat in the stream itself. &ldquo;We connect a pipe and draw water from it. The water is clean. We have no choice because our customers don&rsquo;t want dirty modogu,&rdquo; one of the women said.The women told the SunTeam they visit the stream three times a week to wash their stock. &ldquo;We have customers who love our mogodu because it&rsquo;s so clean.&rdquo;However, a man watching the women from a distance said: &ldquo;People are eating dirt but they don&rsquo;t know it. &ldquo;I personally won&rsquo;t buy from these women because I see them every day washing mogodu at the stream. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t even know how the food we buy from so-called restaurants is prepared.&rdquo; Washing food in polluted water can cause serious diseases.Bacterial diseases like salmonella and shigella and acute diarrhoea caused by E.coli are some of the diseases that can be contracted from polluted water sources.Viral diseases that can damage intestines can also be found in polluted water.Sewage water can also leak into rivers and the chance of contracting diseases like these is very high if this happens.
