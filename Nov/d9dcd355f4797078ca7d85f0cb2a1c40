IT WAS a sad day on Saturday for the Mokhini family when they buried relative Mpho Mokhini (40) and her daughter Koketso (14). At the same time, the Mahlangu family was burying their loved one, Phindile Mahlangu (8).They all died in a road accident on 13 November in Lethabong near Rustenburg, North West.Phindile&rsquo;s father, Bupi Mokhini, was the driver of the bakkie. The families were travelling from a cleansing ceremony in Ledig, near Sun City, when the bakkie overturned. To add to their grief, on Friday the Mahlangus got the message that Phindile&rsquo;s younger sister had also died.Phindile was a grade 2 pupil at Barelwanedi Primary School, while Koketso was a grade 8 pupil at Rethusegile Secondary. The funerals were delayed to give some of the people injured in the accident a chance to attend the funeral. Some of the injured are still in hospital. On Saturday pupils from Barelwanedi, family members, neighbours and friends came to bid their final farewell to Phindile while those from Rethusegile did the same for Koketso and her mother.One of Phindile&rsquo;s teachers described her as a respectful child who was quiet and disciplined. She said Phindile was never naughty in class.At the other funeral, Koketso&rsquo;s fellow grade 8 pupils said she was a role model who never got into trouble and her teachers spoke fondly of her.
