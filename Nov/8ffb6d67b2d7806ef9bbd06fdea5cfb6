In Matthew 7:15 Jesus warned the people to &ldquo;watch out for false prophets.They come to you in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves&rdquo;. A false prophet is not judged by his prophecies but rather by his conduct, behaviour or fruits.False prophets can therefore predict correct events or foretell accurately things to come (Deut. 13:1-3). False prophets can prophesy using the name of Jesus; they can cast out demons using the name of Jesus; they can also perform miracles in the name of Jesus.The Lord Jesus has confirmed this reality in Matthew 7: 22 which states: &ldquo;Many will say in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not PROPHESIED in thy name?And in thy name CAST OUT DEVILS? And in thy name DONE MANY WONDERFUL works (miracles)? Jesus tells us that in that judgment day, He will say to these false prophets: &ldquo;I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity (lawlessness).In Jeremiah 23:21 God says: &ldquo;I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.&rdquo;True prophets preach repentance and obedience to God&rsquo;s law.Jeremiah 23:22 confirms this reality and states: &ldquo;But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.&rdquo;Although people were warned of the rise of these prophets, the Bible predicts in Jeremiah 14:14-16 that many people would still prefer these false prophets and will follow them.God will finally bring judgment to false prophets and their followers (Deuteronomy 18:20).Child of God, pay attention to the words of this teaching, stay away from prophets of doom lest you be doomed!
