PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma must resign before he takes South Africa back to the apartheid era. This was according to Albertina Luthuli, daughter of former ANC president Chief Albert Luthuli. She was speaking at Gugu Dlamini Park in Durban yesterday at the Hands Off Our Treasury protest. &ldquo;The ANC needs to fire their president if they want to stay in power.&rdquo; About 200 people attended the protest in support of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. The Active Citizens Movement, which organised the campaign, said what&rsquo;s happening is a political game.Super Zuma, the ANC provincial secretary, said they don&rsquo;t engage with their members through the media. &ldquo;Zuma was not elected by individuals but residents of the country. Therefore we cannot just fire him.&rdquo;
