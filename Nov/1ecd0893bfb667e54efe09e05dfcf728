FROM outside, this kasi looks peaceful and quiet, but residents have been hiding a dark secret. A man known to residents and business people in Lenasia, south of Joburg, has allegedly defrauded scores of people of millions of rands! The alleged conman &ndash; whose identity is known to the SunTeam &ndash; has been accused of promising neighbours, friends, relatives and local businesses big tenders for an advance fee. The man has reportedly scammed his victims out of more than R50 million with individuals paying him between R100 000 and R1 million each! The alleged conman, a resident of Lenasia, was described by his victims as a popular man who always wore ANC T-shirts and hung around with well-known politicians. The victims said when they realised they had been scammed, they opened fraud cases at the Lenasia Police Station two weeks ago. The suspect has since made two court appearances but was denied bail. He was due back in court in January to face several charges of fraud. A victim told Daily Sun many who were scammed were afraid to publicly identify themselves because the case involved a lot of money. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m one of many who lost money in this thing but I was brave enough to report the matter to the police. We&rsquo;re happy he&rsquo;s been arrested but the big question is whether we&rsquo;ll get our money back,&rdquo; she said. ANC Joburg region spokesman Jolidee Matongo said he had not heard of the allegations. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know this guy and we&rsquo;ve never heard about him,&rdquo; said Matongo. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubela confirmed that a case of fraud was opened and the suspect would appear in court next year.
