He was arrested on October 16.Dlamini appeared to be in good spirits as he stood in the dock before court proceedings started.He was dressed in a green T-shirt bearing the face of struggle hero Solomon Mahlangu.After court adjourned, Dlamini told the media he had the utmost confidence in his legal team, which he said would take the matter forward."We have been victims of circumstances where state machinery has been used for political reasons. I think we are on the right track."Dlamini was granted R2 000 bail in the High Court Sitting in Palm Ridge on November 9.His lawyers have also argued that the charges against him are politically motivated.Dlamini's attorney Thabo Kwinana said they are applying for a permanent stay of prosecution, citing political interference as the motive for charges against him.Kwinana said they have already written to the National Prosecuting Authority and the matter will be heard in the High Court in Johannesburg once a court date has been scheduled.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/fmf-leader-mcebo-dlaminis-trial-postponed-20161115
