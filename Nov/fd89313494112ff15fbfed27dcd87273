COMMUTERS were left stranded yesterday after Rea Vaya bus drivers in Joburg went on strike. Bus stations were closed and commuters were forced to look for alternative transport to work.Hundreds of buses were seen parked at the Dobsonville depot in Soweto, which was under heavy police guard. A driver said they went on strike because a number of issues they were facing had not been addressed. The 35-year-old driver said: &ldquo;A few weeks ago, we marched to the offices of the mayor and the MEC for transport to submit our memoranda.&rdquo; He said among their grievances were their salaries and working conditions. They also wanted to work directly for the City of Joburg and not for outsourced companies. He claimed drivers have been suspended or dismissed because of mechanical problems with the buses. &ldquo;One of our colleagues was dismissed because his bus overheated. &ldquo;He reported there was something wrong with the bus, but was told to drive it anyway. &ldquo;They say it would cool down by itself. &ldquo;When the engine was eventually damaged, he was dismissed for negligence and damage to company property.&rdquo; The City of Joburg apologised for any inconvenience caused by the strike. A media statement from the municipality read: &ldquo;The city will engage with the bus operating companies to establish the cause of the service disruption. &ldquo;We will provide regular feedback to passengers and the public through the media and our Facebook and Twitter accounts.&rdquo;
