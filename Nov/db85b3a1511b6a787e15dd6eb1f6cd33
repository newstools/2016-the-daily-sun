US Ambassador to Malawi Virginia Palmer has reportedly announced that the US government has donated an additional $23 million to Malawi for food aid programmes.&nbsp; According to the Nyasa Times, this came at the back of a recent report by the Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee (MVAC), which indicated that at least 6.5 million Malawians needed humanitarian food.Follow&nbsp;News24 Africa&nbsp;on&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;and&nbsp;Twitter.&nbsp;The funds would reportedly be channelled through the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), which has been responsible for poverty alleviation programmes in the southern African country.Reports indicated that an estimated 40 million people in the southern African region were in dire need of food assistance, among them, Malawi, Zimbabwe and Mozambique.The UN agencies recently&nbsp;warned that southern African countries were at risk of another year of food shortages&nbsp;as the drought-hit region was expected to be hit by above-average rainfall likely to trigger floods.The region was still reeling from the effects of the El Nino weather phenomenon which devastated crops leaving at least 18 million people in need of food aid, according to the WFP.Meteorologists, however, forecast the region would this year experience more rainfall than normal due to an extreme weather pattern known as La Nina. http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/us-donates-additional-23m-for-food-aid-to-malawi-report-2016110
