THE Khumalos are desperately looking for the lost graves of their ancestors.Ivy (64) and Anderson Khumalo (60) from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun their parents were buried in Pretoria in a place that is no longer a grave site. Ivy said her parents&rsquo; final resting place was used to build a camp for soldiers in 1975. She said she had the calling but when she went to thwasa, she was told she had to do certain rituals on her mum and dad&rsquo;s graves. However, she has no idea where their remains are. &ldquo;We were removed from the land when we were very young and all the graves were tampered with,&rdquo; she said. Ivy said there had been many fights and misunderstandings in her family, and whenever they consulted a sangoma, she was told their dead parents were angry and that she and her brother needed to perform rituals. &ldquo;Where should we go and find the graves? This has affected everyone in the family and we don&rsquo;t know where to turn,&rdquo; she said. She said she lost an eye after her own sister threw a stone at her. &ldquo;We fought when she wanted money to buy beer. I only had money for food and I ended up losing my one eye. Sangomas told me this happened because the ancestors were angry,&rdquo; said Ivy. Anderson said bad luck constantly plagued their family. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t find jobs and nothing works out for us,&rdquo; he said.
