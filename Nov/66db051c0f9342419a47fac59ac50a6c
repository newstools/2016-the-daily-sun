When she finished and opened her eyes, her shack was gone!Prudence is one of the 200 families that lost their shacks at Mavuso Valley in Nellmapius, east of Tshwane during a storm over the weekend. &ldquo;I looked around and found that my shack was now in my neighbour&rsquo;s yard, upside down. It was a disaster and people were running around trying to find shelter I joined them,&rdquo; she said. Prudence added most people were afraid to seek shelter in the few shacks that were still standing. &ldquo;We were afraid to go inside the shacks because we thought they too would be blown away. We ended up going under the trees and prayed there until the rain stopped.&rdquo; Pleasure Tshabalala (24) was not so lucky because he nearly lost his hand. &ldquo;I opened my door to let people in. That&rsquo;s when the wind blew my roof off. I saw an iron sheet flying towards my daughter and blocked it with my hand and it slashed it open.&rdquo; He said after that a plastic bath tub hit him from behind and he fell. &ldquo;I am happy that I was able to protect my daughter. After the bath tub hit me I took it and hid under it with my daughter,&rdquo; he said. After the rain stopped neighbours took him to the hospital where his hand was stitched. Vusi Msiza (35) said he was called to the area to help and was shocked when he got there. &ldquo;I thought it was only a few families that were affected and that I would accommodate them in my living room, but I was shocked when I saw half the community crying and praying under trees.&rdquo;He added because he could not do anything for them, he decided to join them in prayer.
