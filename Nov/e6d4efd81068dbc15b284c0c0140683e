NO ONE should lay down instructions about how to establish a judicial commission of inquiry, said President Jacob Zuma, challenging the way the State of Capture Report has been drafted.In the report, former public protector Thuli Madonsela suggested Chief Justice Mogoeneg Mogoeng should submit to Zuma the name of a person to head the judicial commission.&ldquo;Nobody will instruct the president to set up a commission, no matter who they are. The president has the power to establish a commission of inquiry,&rdquo; Zuma said.He denied instructing Co-operative Governance Minister Des van Royeen and Minerals Minister Msebenzi Zwane to interdict the release of the report. He said they were exercising their consitutional rights and didn&rsquo;t need his permission.Zuma said the move to close the Gupta accounts was suspicious. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look innocent that the banks just closed the Guptas accounts willy-nilly. We have to look into this.&rdquo; On Fees Must Fall, Zuma appealed for patience while the commission he established looked into free education.&ldquo;No child who wants to go school will be denied because they have no money,&rdquo; he said.On the possibility of an economic downgrade, Zuma said there was a tendency to politicise it, whereas this was happening all around the world. Zuma said the 27% unemployment rate was cause for concern.
