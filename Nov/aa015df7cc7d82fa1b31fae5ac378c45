Avuyile Mngxitama-Diko, a journalist from The Herald, was assaulted. Shame on you, ANC. &ldquo;We want to build RDP houses and get rid of the bucket toilet system. I have written a letter to Premier Phumulo Masualle, asking him to stop the people who disrupt our programmes.&rdquo;The SunTeam tried to get a comment from ANC national spokesman Zizi Kodwa and ANC regional spokesman Gift Ngqondi, but they did not answer calls or return SMSes sent to them. ANC ward 4 spokesman Mzukisi Ngcape, who was there when Trollip was harassed, said: &ldquo;I have no comment. &ldquo;We are busy trying to get comment from the region.&rdquo;
