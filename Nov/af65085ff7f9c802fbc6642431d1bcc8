THREE men suspected of terrorising residents of Verulam&rsquo;s CBD ran out of luck on Wednesday. The men aged between 25 and 35 were bust by members of Reaction Unit South Africa who handed them to cops in Verulam, north of Durban. Their arrest came after they allegedly robbed a man of his bank card at an ATM. Reaction Unit South Africa, spokesman Prem Balram said their officers received information about a robbery on Ireland Street. &ldquo;When we arrived on the scene, the victim gave officers a detailed description of the suspects. He then blocked his bank card to avoid withdrawals from his account.&rdquo; He said while patrolling the area, a few minutes later the officers spotted the suspects hanging around an ATM in another part of town. &ldquo;The officers approached them and searched them. Several bank cards were found in their possession. The victim arrived on scene and positively identified all three suspects. They were placed under arrest and a Toyota Conquest which belonged to one of them was handed over to authorities for further investigation,&rdquo; Balram said.Residents were relieved when they heard the news. Sipho Mda (46) said a number of robberies had been &shy;reported in town and many people were scared to go to ATMs. Sibusiso Simama (33) said next time the officers should hand over suspects to residents for a round of street justice. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said no case was opened at Verulam Police Station. &ldquo;The victim did not open a case after he realised that his money was not taken. The suspects were warned and released.&rdquo;
