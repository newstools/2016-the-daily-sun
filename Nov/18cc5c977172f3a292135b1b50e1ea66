RESIDENTS have been warned to be vigilant when withdrawing money at ATMs and not to accept help from strangers.The warning comes after the arrest of an alleged card cloner (33) who was found in possession of a number of cloning devices, bank cards, Sassa cards, sim cards, laptops and digital cameras. He was arrested at Gobandlovu in Esikhaleni, north of KZN on Friday and will appear in court on a fraud charge. KZN cop spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said the suspect will be profiled to see if he is linked to any other fraud cases reported in the Uthungulu cluster and surrounding areas. She said a joint operation by members of the KZN tracking team, war room and crime intelligence resulted in the arrest of the man. Mbhele said the man is expected to make his first appearance in the Commercial Crime Court today.KZN acting provincial commissioner, Major-General Bheki Langa, advised the public to look out for devices that may be attached to the ATM as these could be used to clone their cards.
