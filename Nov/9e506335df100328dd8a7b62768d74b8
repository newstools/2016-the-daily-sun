FREE State Stars held their nerve to edge Kaizer Chiefs 6-5 in a nail-biting penalty shoot&shy;out to reach the semifinal of the Telkom Knockout for the first time. The sides were level at 2-2 after extra time in an exciting Telkom Knockout quarterfinal played at a wet Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban yesterday.Ea Lla Koto&rsquo;s reward is an away semifinal against Cape Town City. In the other semifinal SuperSport United will play Orlando Pirates at home on the weekend of 25 November.Chiefs were stung in the ninth minute from an unusual source when leftback Bokang Thlone waltzed through the dozy Amakhosi defence and unleashed a rocket into the top far corner that gave keeper Itumeleng Khune no chance.After that Chiefs laid siege to the Ea Lla Koto goal, where keeper and Man of the Match Thela Ngobeni was in brilliant form despite the soaking wet conditions making it hard for both keepers.Ngobeni, who started in Chiefs&rsquo; junior ranks, continued to thwart his former club with a brilliant, confident goalkeeping display that kept Stars in the game. He did blot his copybook when he was booked by referee Victor Hlungwani for time-wasting.However, Chiefs midfield star Siphiwe &ldquo;Shabba&rdquo; Tshabalala was lucky not to have been booked midway through the half when he tried to &ldquo;con&rdquo; the referee into awarding him a penalty. He claimed Ngobeni had tripped him as both players went for a loose ball. Television replays showed Ngobeni did not touch Shabba, whose simulation deserved punishment.Chiefs head coach Steve Komphela started with a more attacking 3-4-3 formation to try and solve the club&rsquo;s recent goal drought. They have failed to score in open play in the last three matches in all competitions.Chiefs created numerous chances but Ngobeni&rsquo;s heroics continued in the second half, when he twice denied Tshabalala and Michelle Katsvairo with point blank saves. But he could do nothing to stop substitute Elmore Chirambadare from taking the game to extra time when the Zimbabwean striker hammered home the equaliser in the 83rd minute.A minute earlier Chiefs defender Lorenzo Godinho was lucky not to have seen red and concede a penalty when he crunched striker Moeketsi Sekola just inside the danger area.Stars substitute Thokozani Sekotlong made it 2-1 in the 98th minute but a header from Eric Mathoho in the 109th minute took the game into the dreaded penalty shootout.
